Do you want me to do that?To you all❤️ To Everyone Who Has Supported Me — Thank You. Sometimes the words “thank you” don’t feel big enough to express the kind of gratitude I carry in my heart. But today, I just want to pause and speak from that space — the one filled with appreciation for each and every one of you who’s been part of my journey, whether loudly or quietly. To my followers — the ones who’ve been here from the start, and those who just joined — thank you. Thank you for being present, for engaging with my content, for sharing it, for liking it, for commenting, and even for silently watching and supporting from a distance. Every click, every reaction, every message has meant more than you know. Some of you share my work without tagging me. Some of you recommend me in rooms I haven’t entered. Some of you defend me in spaces I’ll never see. Some of you speak my name with respect when I’m not even in the conversation. And even though I may never hear those words directly — I feel them. And I appreciate you. Then there are those of you who don’t follow me, but still show love. You don’t have to follow me to recognize my efforts, my growth, or my content. You support from the sidelines, and it still matters. Your support is just as powerful, just as appreciated, just as seen. Whether you’re a quiet observer or someone who occasionally engages — thank you. You’re part of the impact, and your energy adds to the momentum. Support comes in many forms, and I’ve learned to appreciate every version of it. Some people show love loudly, others do it quietly — both are valid. Both are beautiful. It’s easy to focus on numbers, algorithms, and growth — but none of that compares to the value of real support from real people. I don’t take it for granted. I know you don’t have to be here. I know you could scroll past. But you choose to be part of this space, this voice, this message — and that means everything. To those who’ve reached out privately just to say, “Keep going” — you have no idea how those words land. Some of you have lifted my spirit without even realizing it. You’ve reminded me why I do what I do. Why I share. Why I stay consistent. Your encouragement fuels my resilience. To those who have tagged their friends, told someone about my work, or shared my name in conversations — thank you. That kind of support is powerful. You’ve expanded my reach without asking for anything in return. You’ve amplified my voice simply because you believed in what I offer. That’s loyalty. That’s love. To those who’ve never met me, but believe in me — I see you. It’s one thing to support someone you know. It’s another to support a stranger based on what they share, how they make you feel, or what they stand for. You don’t owe me anything, and yet you give your energy, attention, and kindness. I’m grateful for that. I’ve grown so much — not just because of what I do, but because of the people around me who chose to believe in it. Because of those who didn’t just watch, but encouraged. Those who didn’t just consume, but connected. Those who didn’t just scroll, but stopped to say, “This matters.” Your support isn’t just about helping me grow — it’s a reminder that what I say, what I create, and who I am has value. That I don’t need to change or shrink or water down. That being myself is enough. And that kind of validation — the organic, unforced kind — is priceless. I’ve grown. I’ve glowed up — not just outside, but inside. I’ve unlearned the lies I once told myself and relearned the truth of who I am. I’ve walked away from what wasn’t serving me, even when it hurt. I’ve stood alone in rooms I once felt lost in, and found power in my own presence. I’ve cried. I’ve laughed. I’ve broken and rebuilt. Over and over. There were days I didn’t believe in myself. But *someone* did. Maybe it was you. Maybe it was someone who shared my post. Maybe it was someone who said, “You inspire me.” Those moments matter. You matter. I believe in divine timing now. I believe that everything and everyone comes into your life for a reason — to teach, to test, to heal, or to bless. And many of you, whether intentionally or not, have been a blessing. I’ve found encouragement in strangers, love in distant friends, and confidence in small milestones. That’s why I don’t take any of you for granted. Every like, every share, every “Keep going” has helped me keep *showing up*. And for that, I thank you — deeply and honestly. This journey has taught me that you don’t need to be famous to be impactful. You don’t need millions of followers to touch lives. Sometimes, just being real, being honest, being *you*… that’s enough. So, if you’re reading this, and you’ve ever thought, “They don’t notice me,” — I do. Maybe not always by name, but by energy. I feel the love. I see the support. I carry it with me. And this is not just about me — it’s about *us*. We’ve built something here. Something genuine. Something powerful. I hope that when you see my posts, you feel inspired. Not because I’m perfect, but because I’m proof that *healing is possible, growth is real, and dreams are valid.* I hope my words make you pause and reflect. I hope my heart reminds you that softness is strength. I hope my presence tells you: *you’re not alone.* And if you’re in a season of uncertainty right now — I see you. Keep going. It’s okay to outgrow people, places, and versions of yourself. It’s okay to take breaks. To protect your peace. To choose yourself. Growth can be quiet. Healing can be slow. But both are beautiful. As for me… I’m still becoming. I don’t have it all figured out. I’m still healing, still dreaming, still making sense of some parts of life. But I’ve made peace with that. I’ve stopped rushing the process. I’ve started trusting the pace. And most of all, I’ve started *trusting myself.* So, this post isn’t just gratitude — it’s a celebration. Of growth. Of connection. Of real people showing real love in a sometimes fake world. Whether we’ve known each other for years, months, or just a few scrolls — I thank you. If you’ve ever shared my words, laughed at my reels, related to my captions — I thank you. If you’ve ever whispered a prayer, told a friend, or simply sent good energy my way — I thank you. This space we’ve created together isn’t just about posts. It’s about purpose. It’s about healing, truth, love, and evolution. And I’m grateful to be on this journey with you. To those who support in silence: you’re just as powerful. To those who cheer loudly: you’re just as appreciated. To those who are just observing: welcome — I hope you find what you didn’t know you were looking for. As I continue to grow, evolve, and step into higher versions of myself, I promise to keep showing up — with truth, with heart, with purpose. And I hope you keep walking with me. From my heart to yours: *Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.* 💫 #GratefulHeart #ThankYouFam #SupportMatters #RealOnes #HealingJourney #GrowingTogether #EnergyMatters #StillBecoming #MuchLove --- The of to a and in that is for on it with as was he his

Do you want me to do that?To you all❤️ To Everyone Who Has Supported Me — Thank You. Sometimes the words “thank you” don’t feel big enough to express the kind of gratitude I carry in my heart. But today, I just want to pause and speak from that space — the one filled with appreciation for each and every one of you who’s been part of my journey, whether loudly or quietly. To my followers — the ones who’ve been here from the start, and those who just joined — thank you. Thank you for being present, for engaging with my content, for sharing it, for liking it, for commenting, and even for silently watching and supporting from a distance. Every click, every reaction, every message has meant more than you know. Some of you share my work without tagging me. Some of you recommend me in rooms I haven’t entered. Some of you defend me in spaces I’ll never see. Some of you speak my name with respect when I’m not even in the conversation. And even though I may never hear those words directly — I feel them. And I appreciate you. Then there are those of you who don’t follow me, but still show love. You don’t have to follow me to recognize my efforts, my growth, or my content. You support from the sidelines, and it still matters. Your support is just as powerful, just as appreciated, just as seen. Whether you’re a quiet observer or someone who occasionally engages — thank you. You’re part of the impact, and your energy adds to the momentum. Support comes in many forms, and I’ve learned to appreciate every version of it. Some people show love loudly, others do it quietly — both are valid. Both are beautiful. It’s easy to focus on numbers, algorithms, and growth — but none of that compares to the value of real support from real people. I don’t take it for granted. I know you don’t have to be here. I know you could scroll past. But you choose to be part of this space, this voice, this message — and that means everything. To those who’ve reached out privately just to say, “Keep going” — you have no idea how those words land. Some of you have lifted my spirit without even realizing it. You’ve reminded me why I do what I do. Why I share. Why I stay consistent. Your encouragement fuels my resilience. To those who have tagged their friends, told someone about my work, or shared my name in conversations — thank you. That kind of support is powerful. You’ve expanded my reach without asking for anything in return. You’ve amplified my voice simply because you believed in what I offer. That’s loyalty. That’s love. To those who’ve never met me, but believe in me — I see you. It’s one thing to support someone you know. It’s another to support a stranger based on what they share, how they make you feel, or what they stand for. You don’t owe me anything, and yet you give your energy, attention, and kindness. I’m grateful for that. I’ve grown so much — not just because of what I do, but because of the people around me who chose to believe in it. Because of those who didn’t just watch, but encouraged. Those who didn’t just consume, but connected. Those who didn’t just scroll, but stopped to say, “This matters.” Your support isn’t just about helping me grow — it’s a reminder that what I say, what I create, and who I am has value. That I don’t need to change or shrink or water down. That being myself is enough. And that kind of validation — the organic, unforced kind — is priceless. I’ve grown. I’ve glowed up — not just outside, but inside. I’ve unlearned the lies I once told myself and relearned the truth of who I am. I’ve walked away from what wasn’t serving me, even when it hurt. I’ve stood alone in rooms I once felt lost in, and found power in my own presence. I’ve cried. I’ve laughed. I’ve broken and rebuilt. Over and over. There were days I didn’t believe in myself. But *someone* did. Maybe it was you. Maybe it was someone who shared my post. Maybe it was someone who said, “You inspire me.” Those moments matter. You matter. I believe in divine timing now. I believe that everything and everyone comes into your life for a reason — to teach, to test, to heal, or to bless. And many of you, whether intentionally or not, have been a blessing. I’ve found encouragement in strangers, love in distant friends, and confidence in small milestones. That’s why I don’t take any of you for granted. Every like, every share, every “Keep going” has helped me keep *showing up*. And for that, I thank you — deeply and honestly. This journey has taught me that you don’t need to be famous to be impactful. You don’t need millions of followers to touch lives. Sometimes, just being real, being honest, being *you*… that’s enough. So, if you’re reading this, and you’ve ever thought, “They don’t notice me,” — I do. Maybe not always by name, but by energy. I feel the love. I see the support. I carry it with me. And this is not just about me — it’s about *us*. We’ve built something here. Something genuine. Something powerful. I hope that when you see my posts, you feel inspired. Not because I’m perfect, but because I’m proof that *healing is possible, growth is real, and dreams are valid.* I hope my words make you pause and reflect. I hope my heart reminds you that softness is strength. I hope my presence tells you: *you’re not alone.* And if you’re in a season of uncertainty right now — I see you. Keep going. It’s okay to outgrow people, places, and versions of yourself. It’s okay to take breaks. To protect your peace. To choose yourself. Growth can be quiet. Healing can be slow. But both are beautiful. As for me… I’m still becoming. I don’t have it all figured out. I’m still healing, still dreaming, still making sense of some parts of life. But I’ve made peace with that. I’ve stopped rushing the process. I’ve started trusting the pace. And most of all, I’ve started *trusting myself.* So, this post isn’t just gratitude — it’s a celebration. Of growth. Of connection. Of real people showing real love in a sometimes fake world. Whether we’ve known each other for years, months, or just a few scrolls — I thank you. If you’ve ever shared my words, laughed at my reels, related to my captions — I thank you. If you’ve ever whispered a prayer, told a friend, or simply sent good energy my way — I thank you. This space we’ve created together isn’t just about posts. It’s about purpose. It’s about healing, truth, love, and evolution. And I’m grateful to be on this journey with you. To those who support in silence: you’re just as powerful. To those who cheer loudly: you’re just as appreciated. To those who are just observing: welcome — I hope you find what you didn’t know you were looking for. As I continue to grow, evolve, and step into higher versions of myself, I promise to keep showing up — with truth, with heart, with purpose. And I hope you keep walking with me. From my heart to yours: *Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.* 💫 #GratefulHeart #ThankYouFam #SupportMatters #RealOnes #HealingJourney #GrowingTogether #EnergyMatters #StillBecoming #MuchLove --- The of to a and in that is for on it with as was he his

Quiet. Kind neighbors. A place where the air felt cleaner, where the world felt slower. • And rural communities, generous as they always are, opened their arms wide. • These new immigrants moved into rural communities and talked about how much they loved the sound of driving on gravel roads, looking up into the sky and seeing stars, and how they enjoyed the feeling of soft soil under their feet. • But now? The murmurs are happening… • Now some of these same newcomers are annoyed …. • “The grocery store is too far.” “There’s nothing for the kids to do.” “We need more amenities, more activities, more, more, more.” • They left one world… then came here and started demanding the old world be rebuilt around them. • Tell me how that’s any different from an immigrant protesting America while waving the flag of the country he fled? • You moved here because it was different. You loved the charm. You loved the peace. You loved the simplicity. • But now that you live here, you have forgotten why you left \"there\". • You want a small town to behave like a big city while still pretending to be a small town? • Impossible. • So if you’re a transplant to a rural community, here’s the truth, spoken with love, and maybe a little annoyance: Learn the language of the land. Honor the history. Respect the sacrifices of the people who built it long before you arrived. And assimilate. • Growth is good when it’s wholesome. Everyone should be \"pro wholesome growth\". • But forced growth? • That’s how you kill the very spirit you came looking for. • Forced growth is how roots snaps instead of growing deeper. • So I encourage you, Breathe the country air.

By Andrew Walsh November 9, 2025 11:00 a.m. ET Leave a Comment (Left to right) John Hannah, Rachel Weisz, a camel, and Brendan Fraser in 'The Mummy'. Credit: Universal Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett *The Mummy*, Stephen Sommers’ rip-roaring reboot of the 1932 Boris Karloff classic, turned star Brendan Fraser into an action hero upon its release in 1999. The horror-comedy-action hybrid wasn’t a sure bet. The resurrection of the Universal monster franchise toiled in development hell for decades, with genre icons like George Romero and Clive Barker attached at various points. The studio wanted a low-budget horror flick, but Sommers pitched a swashbuckling, *Indiana Jones*-inspired take on the creature feature. The rest is ancient history. “I've always wanted to do a version of *The Mummy*,” he ** on its 20th anniversary. “I heard they'd parted ways with another writer-director… One of the first things I said was ‘Nobody wants to see a guy wrapped in bandages; they're going to laugh at it.’” History proved him right. The film earned over $400 million worldwide and received an Oscar nomination for visual effects. In the years since, there have been two sequels, a spinoff franchise, and a Tom Cruise-led reboot. Now, a new *Mummy* movie with Fraser and costar Rachel Weisz is in the works with Radio Silence, the filmmaking team behind horror hits *Ready or Not* (2019) and *Scream VI* (2023). As we wait to see how that project takes shape, let's have a look at what the cast of *The Mummy* has been up to over the past 25 years. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell Brendan Fraser in 'The Mummy'; Fraser at the Ischia Global Fest on July 12, 2023. Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty; Daniele Venturelli/Getty Brendan Fraser played the dashing hero Rick O’Connell, a treasure hunter and former Captain of the French Foreign Legion. \"We didn't know whether we were making a horror movie, we didn't know if this was an action picture, we didn't know if it was a romance picture,” he previously told EW. “All of the above? None of the above? We didn't know. We. Did. Not. Know.” The actor rose to prominence in the early ’90s, standing out in *Encino Man *(1992), *School Ties *(1992), and *Airheads *(1994) before swinging into theaters as *George of the Jungle *(1997) and finding critical acclaim in *Gods and Monsters *(1998). Fraser was bedeviled by Elizabeth Hurley’s Beelzebub in *Bedazzled *(2000), earned career-best reviews for the Vietnam drama *The Quiet American *(2002), and landed a role in the Best Picture-winning *Crash *(2004). Injuries from his years of stunt work required surgeries that curbed his action star status, but he found regular TV work, including *Trust *(2018) and *Doom Patrol *(2019–2023). His road back to big-screen glory began in Steven Soderbergh’s heist movie *No Sudden Move *(2021) and led to his Oscar-winning turn in *The Whale *(2022) and a memorable role in Martin Scorsese’s *Killers of the Flower Moon *(2023). Upcoming projects include Hikari's *Rental Family,* a festival favorite, and the historical war drama *Pressure*, in which he plays Dwight D. Eisenhower. Fraser was married to actress Afton Smith, with whom he shares three sons, from 1998 to 2009. He has been in a relationship with makeup artist Jeanne Moore since 2022. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan Rachel Weisz in 'The Mummy'; Weisz attends the Loewe Paris Womenswear Spring-Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on September 27, 2024. Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett; Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Rachel Weisz played bookworm turned mummy slayer Evelyn Carnahan. The English actress impressed for years on stage and across the arthouse circuit before grabbing the attention of Imhotep — and mainstream audiences — in *The Mummy*. “It was the ’90s and a lot of the women's parts were not very interesting,” she told *Newsweek*. “[Evie] was just a very unusual female character. She was a librarian, and she was in the middle of this action movie. She was funny and kind of mischievous and honest.” That role launched one of the most celebrated screen careers in recent history. Weisz showed off her range in everything from the rom-com *About a Boy *(2002) to the dark graphic novel adaptation *Constantine *(2005) before winning an Oscar for *The Constant Gardener *(2005). How Brendan Fraser helped Dwayne Johnson 'kick off' his acting career Brendan Fraser recalls 'Mummy' costar 'got bit in the nipple' by horse on set After starring in *The Fountain *(2006) — her then-fiancee Darren Aronofsky’s interlocking triptych about conquering death — she stole every scene in Rian Johnson’s *The Brothers Bloom *(2008), and continued cycling between big-budget dramas, such as *The Lovely Bones* (2009), and more intimate ones like *The Deep Blue Sea *(2011). The international star landed on Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos’ radar for his absurdist comedy *The Lobster *(2015); the two reunited for *The Favourite *(2018), where her acerbic performance landed her another Oscar nod. No stranger to blockbusters with *The Bourne Legacy *(2012) and *Oz the Great and Powerful *(2013) on her résumé, Weisz joined the MCU for a villainous role in *Black Widow *(2021). Most recently, she stepped into Jeremy Irons’ scrubs as identical twin gynecologists in the gender-swapped miniseries remake of *Dead Ringers *(2023). She and Aronofsky were engaged for several years and share a son, Henry. In 2011, she married Daniel Craig, and in 2018 the couple welcomed a daughter. In 2013, the two actors shared the stage in *Betrayal*, Weisz’s Broadway debut. John Hannah as Jonathan Carnahan John Hannah in 'The Mummy'; LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 27: Hannah attends the Ascendant Fox Summer Party on July 27, 2023, in London. UNIVERSAL PICTURES/ALPHAVILLE FILMS/Ronald Grant Archive/Mary Evans/Everett Collection; Dave Benett/Getty Scottish actor John Hannah was Evelyn’s troublemaking brother Jonathan. Before unraveling the Mummy, he stole the hearts of audiences with his breakout performance as Matthew in *Four Weddings and a Funeral *(1994), for which he earned a BAFTA nomination, and as Gwyneth Paltrow’s love interest in *Sliding Doors *(1998). “I struggled a bit doing *The Mummy* at first,” he told EW in 2019. “I was like, ‘I don’t understand what I’m doing here!’ Brendan's the hero, and Kevin J. was doing the comedy stuff. I’m like, ‘Steve, what’s my function?’ He said, ‘Just mess around in the background, and if it’s funny, we’ll cover it.’” Hannah starred alongside Denzel Washington in the biopic *The Hurricane *(1999) before reprising Jonathan in *The Mummy Returns *(2001)*. *In the years since, he’s found a consistent home on the small screen, playing key roles in the *Spartacus *franchise, *Damages* (2012), and *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. *(2016–2017). He recently guest starred on HBO’s hit *The Last of Us *(2023). Hannah wed his *Sliding Doors *costar Joanna Roth in 1996. They have two children. Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep Arnold Vosloo in 'The Mummy'; Vosloo in 2022. Universal/Courtesy Everett; Netflix / Courtesy Everett Arnold Vosloo was Imhotep, the cursed mummy who returns from the tomb in search of his lost love. “They go, ‘All right, here's your wardrobe.’ It’s, like, a G-string. I liked my beers; I had a bit of a paunch — still do,” Vosloo previously told EW. “Steve told me afterwards that the wardrobe master said, ‘We’ve got a problem. We’ve got a fat Mummy!’ So in Morocco I was just running and walking and eating whatever it is they make you eat to lose weight.” Before playing the classic villain, Vosloo was a celebrated film, television, and theater actor in his native South Africa. He made his stateside debut in the cult sword-and-sorcery adventure *Gor *(1987) and hunted Jean-Claude Van Damme in John Woo’s *Hard Target *(1993). After his defeat in *The Mummy *movies*, *he menaced *Agent Cody Banks *(2003), costarred with Leonardo DiCaprio in *Blood Diamond *(2006), and shored up his bad-guy bonafides as Cobra agent Zartan in *G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra *(2009) and *G.I. Joe: Retaliation *(2013). His TV work has included *24 *(2005), *Bosch *(2017), and *Jack Ryan *(2019). Vosloo was married to actress Nancy Mulford from 1988 to 1991. He wed marketing director Silvia Ahi in 1998. Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor Kevin J. O'Connor in 'The Mummy'; O'Connor arrives to the premiere of 'Catch-22' at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on May 7, 2019. Universal Pictures; VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Kevin J. O’Connor was the disloyal thief Beni Gabor, whose greed gets the best of him. As he told EW in 2019, making the film was its own adventure: “You'd see one little black cloud and you'd think, 'What is this?' This little black cloud would turn into a sandstorm that was blinding and threw the camera equipment around. It was insane… I chose to wear open-toed sandals for my character. After my first night, I realized how wrong I was. I would look down and see something moving in the sand.” O’Connor was already a well-established character actor, with *Peggy Sue Got Married *(1986), *Steel Magnolias *(1989), *Amistad *(1997), and *Tanner ’88 *(1988) under his belt. After getting eaten alive by scarabs in *The Mummy*, he served as the diabolical lab assistant Igor in Sommers’ *Van Helsing *(2004), then faced a different kind of monster in Paul Thomas Anderson’s *There Will Be Blood *(2007). He joined Patrick Swayze for his final performance in the series *The Beast *(2009) and reunited with Anderson for *The Master *(2012). The Windy City native was a recurring player on *Chicago P.D. *(2014–2015) as well as the Stephen King miniseries *11.22.63 *(2016). In recent years, he has popped up in *Widows *(2018), *Catch-22 *(2019), and the Kirsten Dunst-led series *On Becoming a God in Central Florida *(2019). Jonathan Hyde as Dr. Allen Chamberlain Jonathan Hyde in 'The Mummy'; Hyde poses on the red carpet at the Olivier Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London on April 7, 2019. Universal Pictures; NIKLAS HALLE'N/AFP via Getty Veteran screen presence Jonathan Hyde brought the film’s resident Egyptologist, Dr. Allen Chamberlain, to life. The Australian character actor was best known to Americans as the trustworthy butler in *Richie Rich *(1994), in dual roles in *Jumanji *(1995), and as the historically infamous J. Bruce Ismay in *Titanic *(1997). Modern audiences may recognize him from Guillermo del Toro’s vampire series *The Strain *(2014–2017); he reunited with the genre maestro for the Gothic chiller *Crimson Peak *(2015). Recently Hyde appeared, ironically enough, in *Dr. Jekyll *(2023) with Eddie Izzard, and guest starred as the Duke of Norfolk on *The Crown *(2023). Most recently, Hyde appeared in Brady Corbet's Oscar-winning *The Brutalist* (2024). Hyde wed opera singer Isobel Buchanan in 1980 and they have two children. Their daughter, Georgia King, is also an actor. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay Oded Fehr in 'The Mummy'; BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 12: Actor Oded Fehr attends the 33rd Israel Film Festival in Los Angeles on November 12, 2019. Universal Pictures; JC Olivera/Getty Oded Fehr was Ardeth Bay, leader of the sacred guards tasked with protecting the City of the Dead. “We had no idea when we shot the first *Mummy *that it’s going to be what it ended up being… I heard Rachel going, ‘This is the end of my career,’” he said on *Popverse’*s *Mummy *cast reunion panel. “I was just happy to be there, you know… for me it was my first job.” After *The Mummy Returns, *he faced off with the undead again in *Resident Evil: Apocalypse *(2004) and played the villain Zankou on *Charmed *(2004–2005). Fehr co-headlined Showtime’s *Sleeper Cell *(2005–2006) and landed roles on *NCIS *(2013), *Once Upon a Time *(2016–2017) *The Blacklist *(2015–2019), and *Star Trek: Discovery *(2020–2024). The Israeli actor will return to the Final Frontier for the spin-off *Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.* Fehr and Rhonda Tollefson have been married since 2000 and have three children. Erick Avari as Dr. Terence Bey Erick Avari in 'The Mummy'; Avari attends the 18th annual Official Star Trek Convention at the Rio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas on August 2, 2019. Universal Pictures; Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Erick Avari played Dr. Terence Bey, curator of the Cairo Museum of Antiquities. A two-decade veteran of stage and screen*, *he already had an extensive résumé, including the *Seinfeld *(1989) pilot and supporting turns in *Stargate *(1994), *Independence Day *(1996), and Fraser’s *Encino Man.* The actor mentioned on a podcast in 2015 that his role changed at the last minute: “I was originally cast in the role Jonathan Hyde played and Omar Sharif was set to play the curator, but two weeks before the shoot, they called to say Omar had emergency hip surgery and so they were bumping me up to the role of the curator.” Avari played a human in Tim Burton’s *Planet of the Apes *(2001) and the billionaire businessman father of Jennifer Garner’s Elektra in *Daredevil *(2003). He subsequently settled in on the small screen, booking parts in *Heroes *(2006), *Days of Our Lives *(2009), and *The Brink *(2017). The actor has remained mostly retired since the first season of faith-based drama *The Chosen *(2019). Avari and his wife, Margaret Walker, have been married since 1980. Bernard Fox as Captain Winston Havelock Bernard Fox in 'The Mummy'; Fox attends the Academy of Magical Arts Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills on April 5, 2008. Universal Pictures; Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage Bernard Fox portrayed the overzealous fighter pilot Captain Winston Havelock. The Welsh actor became a sitcom stalwart in the ’60s, appearing on everything from *The Andy Griffith Show *(1963–1965) to *Hogan’s Heroes *(1965–1970). While he remains most noteworthy for his sitcom work, he also holds a unique big-screen distinction: He appeared in two films based on the sinking of the *Titanic*, both *A Night to Remember *(1958) and the ship’s eponymous 1997 blockbuster. *The Mummy *was one of his last acting roles, but he went out with yet another bit of déjà vu, reprising his recurring character from *Bewitched *(1966–1972) on the supernatural soap opera *Passions *(1999–2000). Fox died of heart failure in 2016 at age 89. He and his wife, Jacqueline, were married for over 50 years and had two children. Patricia Velásquez as Anck-su-namun Patricia Velásquez in 'The Mummy'; Velásquez at Cinemark Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles on May 9, 2024. Universal Pictures; Araya Doheny/Getty Patricia Velásquez was Imhotep’s gold-painted lover, the Pharaoh's bride-to-be Anck-su-namun. “It took almost 10 hours to get that makeup on,” she said in 2024. “I have four people drawing on my body, and then they had a special chair so I could sit and the paint would not smear… I had anywhere between two to four hours of retouching every day. It was tough.” After an expanded role in *The Mummy Returns, *Velásquez showed off her comedic chops as Marta on *Arrested Development *(2003–2004) and guested on *Rescue Me *(2004) and *The L Word* (2008). The Venezuelan actress recently appeared in the horror films *The Curse of La Llorona *(2019) and *Malignant *(2021). Off-screen, she has been honored for her philanthropy, having created the Wayuu Taya Foundation to assist the indigenous Wayuu people of Venezuela and Colombia. The United Nations appointed her the UNESCO Artist for Peace in 2003. Velásquez has a daughter, Maya, and is in a relationship with businesswoman Alison Lawton.

Roxas Elementary School Gymnasium on November 14, 2025, for an orientation on the upcoming School-Based Immunization Program led by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Local Government Unit. The session aimed to inform parents about the Measles-Rubella (MR) and Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) vaccines for Grade 1 and the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for Grade 4 girls, all scheduled for administration on December 4, 2025. Representatives from the Mini-Forest Health Center facilitated the discussions to ensure parents understood the importance, procedures, and safety of the immunization process. “This orientation is meant to empower you with knowledge,” said Ma’am Nancy B. Lopez, school principal, as she welcomed attendees. “We encourage you to listen, ask, and clarify anything that concerns your child’s health.” She emphasized that protecting children from preventable diseases begins with informed decisions and active participation of parents. The orientation proceeded with detailed presentations from health experts, addressing both the medical and procedural aspects of the program. Nurse II Karla Eunice C. Rondez explained that vaccines such as MR, Td, and HPV play a vital role in safeguarding children from serious illnesses, noting that Grade 1 learners will receive booster immunizations, while Grade 4 girls will be given HPV shots to prevent cervical cancer later in life. Meanwhile, Nurse II Kathrina Jasmin M. Orilla walked parents through the Parent’s Consent Form, stressing the importance of completing it accurately for the safety and documentation of the immunization process. The School-Based Immunization Program is a nationwide health initiative in partnership with DepEd, DOH, and local government units to increase vaccine coverage among school-age children. It aims to curb outbreaks of measles, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and cervical cancer—diseases that remain significant public health concerns in the country. An open forum concluded the session, giving parents the opportunity to voice their concerns and seek clarifications before the December 4 immunization schedule. Despite uncertainties, many expressed appreciations for the school’s effort to guide families toward informed health decisions. With strengthened collaboration among the school community, health authorities, and parents, MARES continues to champion the well-being and protection of its learners.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1412874267508418","likes":15,"shares":8,"comments":0,"views":0,"text_altered":"#MARESBayanihanForHealth🪧Parents engage in crucial dialogue on School-Based Immunization at MARES Parents and guardians of Grades 1 and 4 learners gathered at the Manuel A.

I remember 12/13/16 like it was yesterday. The pediatrician asked me about milestones and language and I shared something funny that happened. Luka and I were at the grocery store and he was sitting in the front of the cart. There was an elderly man in front of us moving very slowly. Luka starts saying loudly, “go go go!” I was so embarrassed. When she showed me the vaccines he would get that day, I said, “that seems like a lot, are you sure that’s ok?” She looked at them and told me he had all of them before and he had no reaction, right? I said, “no I guess he didn’t.”\n\nAt the grocery store before 12/13/16 was the last time I heard my child say, “go, go, go!”\n\n“Days later, he suffered physical and neurological injuries as evidenced by pictures and videos of a left sided facial droop and left sided body weakness. I didn’t realize at the time it was a vaccine reaction. He was teething very heavily, had a mild fever, quiet, lethargic, and withdrawn and just generally not feeling well. He had a tough, awful time teething, so I thought that was the issue. But later in January, my mom called me in a panic and said, “there’s something wrong with Luka!” She watched him 2 days a week while I worked. I had a babysitter the other days and when I asked the sitter, she noticed the same issues as my mom. I just knew something happened to him when he shut down, stopped responding to his name, staring episodes, and stopped saying words. My baby was ahead of the curve with most developmental milestones then suddenly and dramatically regressed after that round of vaccines.\n\n“I called the pediatrician and early intervention crying and saying I don’t know if he hit his head or if he is traumatized over his nana but he’s different and everyone is concerned. I have a lot of pictures and videos because I went back to try to figure out where my baby went. That’s when I finally made the connection and noticed the injury in the pictures retrospectively. There is a noticeable difference before and after Dec 13th 2016. My son received several EEGs and an MRI that was deemed normal. However, when I pushed for answers, one of the neurologists verbally told me and my husband that our son has “BRAIN DAMAGE .” \n\n” This is not documented anywhere on paper. The only thing documented is a neurological report summary that states “POSSIBLE ENCEPHALITIS or POSSIBLE ADEM”. But he was not formally diagnosed with either. His diagnoses are unspecified nystagmus, developmental regression, disturbance of consciousness, altered mental status, and expressive language disorder. \n\nMost recently found out he is vitamin B12 deficient, despite receiving that supplement since November. And of course he exhibits behaviors that are consistent with ASD.”\n\n“C urrently, my son has no functional language and he is in speech therapy since March 2017, he is frequently ill, spikes fevers for no reason, sweats profusely, has intermittent left arm weakness, small pupils all the time, signs of possible asthma and food allergies, nystagmus which was recently diagnosed and strange spots on his sclera that weren’t there pre-vaccine injury.\n\nMy son is always sick, screaming/crying in pain….”\n\nI want to add that I was once pro vaccine who trusted doctors and believed wholeheartedly in the medical system. \n\nThey poisoned my healthy baby and then turned around and abused him again by lying about it and abandoning him after he was vaccine injured. \n\nThey know what happened to my son. And they know that I know.￼\n\nMy child will never receive another vaccine. \n\nAnd I will never get over what they did to him.”- Carla Moscatelli","language":"en","url":"https://x.com/i/web/status/1987603384241893494","likes":0,"shares":930,"comments":143,"views":50381}

Lots of tears, lots of frustration, and way more restrictions than my impatient, hour-by-hour planner brain can handle. 😅 But even in the messy, slow-motion parts of this journey, I’m still here doing my best to kick cancer’s ass with sass and class. Medical snapshot: 💛 The cancer was removed and all lymph nodes were negative (huge blessing). 🖤 There were still some live cancer cells in the breast — super common in Triple-Negative — so I’ll still need radiation, oral chemo (Xeloda), and Keytruda. 💛 My mastectomy wounds aren’t healing they way we want and radiation can’t start until they do. So… plot twist: I’m having unexpected skin-grafting surgery tomorrow!🩺 My surgeon will remove the damaged tissue and use skin from my hip (bonus lipo, because why not at this point 🙃). Once that heals, I can start the next phase: radiation ➜ oral chemo ➜ onward. This whole experience has humbled me, stretched me, and slowed me down in ways I didn’t ask for… but I’m trusting the process. This is my cocoon — and I fully intend to come out of it stronger, wiser, and more beautiful than before. ✨🦋 Thank you for the prayers, messages, and quiet support. I feel it, and I’m so grateful. 💛","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10163113787044870","likes":39,"shares":0,"comments":86,"views":0}

My name is Raymond Alkakooz. I am a third-year student double majoring in Biomedical Sciences and Global Health. I aspire to be a physician for many reasons. From my journey from Iraq to Phoenix, to serving my community as a first responder, to seeing firsthand the health disparities that affect underserved populations, being a doctor has always been my calling. Witnessing the effects of gang violence, homelessness, and severe illness reinforced my duty to deliver the best care with empathy. Medicine, as a symbol, is incorruptible, enduring, and the purest form of human connection. This is why I pursued both degrees—to become a more well-rounded provider with biological knowledge and cultural inclusiveness. It has been an honor to work under Tomas Nuño, PhD, at the Arizona Prevention Research Center and the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Arizona. During the FRONTERA Summer Internship I researched quantitative and qualitative studies on HPV vaccine use, knowledge, and beliefs among U.S. southern border communities. I gained insights into vaccine hesitancy, cultural factors contributing to disparities, and how culturally tailored interventions can improve uptake. My favorite part of the program was the clinical experience. I externed as a population health technician at El Rio Health, a Federally Qualified Health Center. I conducted outreach for overdue A1C and diabetes retinopathy patients, helped providers prepare for appointments, and coordinated follow-ups with other clinics. A memorable includes receiving recognition from CDC scientific officer Rosalind Carter for my HPV research insights and participating in a clinic trip to deliver free medical care in Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, Mexico, with students from the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson.

The program was inaugurated by Her Excellency Hajiya Salifat Abdullahi Sule, the First Lady of Nasarawa State, who made a passionate appeal for women to take advantage of this opportunity to protect their health. \"Health is wealth. Let us help ourselves by utilizing this free cervical cancer screening provided by the state government and our partners for the well-being of our children,\" she urged. The First Lady emphasized the importance of regular cervical cancer screening and ensuring that young girls receive their HPV vaccinations. She encouraged women to seek medical attention promptly if they experience any symptoms, highlighting that early detection can save lives. Dr. Gaza Gowona, the Commissioner of Health, represented by Permanent Secretary Dr. John Damina, reaffirmed the state government's commitment to ensuring that vaccines and necessary medical equipment are readily available at designated treatment centers for the beneficiaries. He lauded the First Lady for her unwavering dedication to addressing health issues and praised the Executive Secretary of NAPHDA, Dr. Usman Iskilu Saleh, for spearheading the cervical cancer screening initiative. Acknowledging the First Lady's significant role in the success of previous health initiatives, including the measles and rubella vaccination campaign, the Executive Secretary noted that these efforts positioned Nasarawa State at the forefront of vaccine administration. He extended gratitude to the Kwandere community and their traditional ruler, Sangarin Kwandere, for their support. Fatima Maho, State Coordinator of Pathfinder International, expressed delight in the collaboration with the state government to promote awareness and encourage HPV vaccination. \"My final call to you is to ensure you screen, educate, and vaccinate,\" she urged, assuring the community that subsequent screenings would follow in the coming year. Dr. Bosede Ezekiel, the World Health Organization (WHO) State Coordinator, speaking on behalf of other Partiners commended the state government for creating a supportive environment for partners to effectively assist the community. She praised Pathfinder International for their significant contributions to the cervical cancer screening and HPV immunization efforts. Marvellous Andrew, a beneficiary of the free medical outreach, expressed her gratitude towards the state government and Pathfinder International for launching the timely program, which would allow her to ascertain her cervical cancer status. This vital medical outreach initiative aims to screen over 100 women in the state, with immediate treatment options available for those who test positive for cervical cancer. Through this collaborative effort, NAPHDA and Pathfinder International are taking significant steps toward reducing cervical cancer risk and promoting public health in Nasarawa State.

Forrest got scared but did okay once we convinced him we weren't there for him. It started out with us meeting with the Dr. Then we went to another part of the hospital for Kyle to have labs drawn, Kristin went with him while Forrest and I waited. They came out, we then had lunch and headed back to the oncology department. Then the news. My sister Sara was able to shade the mass that we're dealing with so it'll be easier to see. Kyle goes in this coming Thursday for his port, he'll then be admitted, then they start the chemo. He'll be there for 5 days, immune system completely suppressed but they're hoping he'll be home either before or on Thanksgiving day. This was like Dejavu all over again. The flashbacks I had were incredible. Kyle's mass was compared to \"jello\", it's a mass but it's not solid. We go in on Thursday, Kyle will have his port put in, then he'll be admitted. Chemo will start as soon as they're ready. My son will lose his hair. They're putting him on Ifosimide and Adriamycin in hopes to shrink or kill the tumor so it can be removed. As for the blood clot, he's to remain on Eliquis in hopes that it'll destroy the clot and his system will absorb it. They won't put in a graft to catch it because all that will do is create another clot. They're hoping Kyle will be home by Thanksgiving. He'll have to do this, like Forrest and me, every 3 weeks. One week inpatient, 2 weeks out, only where footrest and I come home, he'll stay. We're going to have to be extremely careful because he'll be immunocompromised. Even now, if Kristin and I take Forrest to the store, we hear a cough and we still rush Forrest as far away as possible in the other direction or we just leave. Kristin will stay with Kyle unless we trade off. Forrest and Kyle are the utmost priority. If Forrest will tolerate it, we'll stay with Kyle. We have a rule, we stay together, no matter what.

Roxanne Khamsi November 19, 2025 Medical weight loss might be on the verge of a further revolution. For starters, people will likely have the option of taking a new class of medications that seem to have fewer bothersome side effects, such as nausea—which affects about half the people on Ozempic and similar drugs. Those now-familiar medications target a pathway involving the appetite-regulating hormone GLP-1; the new ones target cell receptors for a different hormone, amylin. AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Zealand Pharma, and, of course, Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic, are all testing amylin-based obesity drugs. And if the increasing number of new weight-loss medications seems hard to choose from, you might not have to pick just one. Some medications in development, such as CagriSema, go one step beyond, combining components that target amylin and GLP-1 to make even more powerful drugs. In a recent trial, individuals with obesity who took an amylin-based drug called cagrilintide lost about 12 percent of their weight over the course of 16 months. Those on semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, lost about 15 percent. Those taking CagriSema lost, on average, more than 20 percent. (By comparison, bariatric surgery, a dramatic procedure that reconfigures the digestive system, can cause a person to lose about 30 percent of their weight—but it comes with the possibility of serious complications such as hernias and life-threatening infections.) These new combination drugs are pressing weight loss far enough past the limits of existing drugs that the field of obesity research is facing an unprecedented question: How far should medical weight loss go? Thomas Lutz, who is known by his contemporaries as the “amylin guy,” has been conducting amylin research at the University of Zurich since the early 1990s, beginning only a few years after amylin had been isolated and characterized in pancreatic cells. Some scientists looked at the molecule with suspicion because it had been isolated in deposits within the pancreas of diabetic patients. Lutz and others helped show that it could reduce appetite in animals. But, perhaps partly because of the lingering mystery of why amylin deposits occur in the body, he found that the wider field took quite a while to get interested in his and other amylin researchers’ work. “We were probably considered outsiders by many others in the field,” Lutz told me. Most of his peers were focused on GLP-1, or leptin, or other peptides—molecules made of the same building blocks as proteins, but smaller. “Not many labs really focused on amylin.” The compound has been used as a drug in the past, Lutz said, albeit in less potent incarnations. Pramlintide, an analogue of amylin, was approved by the FDA for treating diabetes in 2005. The formulation degrades rapidly enough that it has to be injected before every major meal, though; cagrilintide sticks around longer and is injected only once a week. Pramlintide also doesn’t have as big an effect on weight loss compared with the more recent array of amylin drugs. In one trial, twice as many people receiving it lost at least 5 percent of their body weight after four months, relative to those receiving the placebo. But that’s a modest effect. Amylin is just one of a bevy of hormones involved in metabolism that pharmaceutical companies are thinking of using as components in future weight-loss therapies. “Companies are kind of going down the list,” looking at peptides that are secreted after meals and might have commercial potential, Kevin Hall, a metabolism scientist and co-author of the new book Food Intelligence, told me. There are drugs in the works that join the action of GLP-1 with that of GIP, a hormone released from the upper intestine, despite uncertainty about how GIP influences appetite. Some companies are looking at drugs based on the hormone glucagon. Others are investigating peptide YY, a gut hormone that signals to the brain that a meal has been consumed. Because the body tends to adapt to drugs that depend on just one hormonal mechanism, combination medications that target multiple hormones should yield more effective treatments, Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine who’s on the governing board of the Obesity Society, told me. As the available combinations increase and the weight-loss effects presumably nudge up as well, the question becomes: How much weight loss should these medications aim to produce? “The fact that we have to ask that question is crazy,” Tchang said. “Five years ago, we couldn’t ask that question, because we weren’t hitting these thresholds.” For many individuals with obesity who lose about 5 percent of their weight, their blood levels of certain fat molecules start to improve. At about 10 percent weight loss, their risk of heart attack and stroke typically goes down. When weight loss reaches more than 15 percent, some people start to see the resolution of health problems that often go hand in hand with obesity. “It’s not that their high blood pressure is only getting better,” Tchang said. “It’s going away.” But not everyone sees their risk factors go away when they lose 15 or 20 percent of their weight, which is one reason doctors see a market for more potent drugs. Many people who are morbidly obese need to shed a higher percentage of weight to achieve certain health goals, which is why some undergo bariatric surgery, even with all of its associated risks. Of course, people who are less obese might not benefit from losing a lot of weight. “Not all of our patients need 20 percent, 25 percent, 30 percent weight loss,” Timothy Garvey, an endocrinologist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has led trials of amylin drugs, told me. “In fact, it’s unhealthy for many people, and it’s way beyond what we need to improve health.” Doctors often consider body mass index (the imperfect but broadly used measure based on someone’s weight and height) to judge if someone is over- or underweight: A BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight. If someone’s weight loss causes their BMI to fall below that in a clinical trial, the person generally has to leave the experiment. But social pressures to lose weight can be tremendous, and GLP-1 drugs are already available at online pharmacies, where physician oversight is less rigorous. Some doctors worry that if more potent combination drugs come along—at the same time that generic GLP-1 drugs are available—people might take their weight loss too far. Since GLP-1 drugs have been widely available, people have used them not just to tend to their health but also to modify their appearance. Christoffer Clemmensen, an obesity researcher at the University of Copenhagen, drew a parallel between the excessive use of weight-loss medications and inappropriate uses of anabolic steroids to bulk up muscles. Without support from a doctor or other medical professionals, people using these drugs, or even more effective ones, could lose significant muscle mass, Michael Lyon, the medical director of the Obesity Medicine and Diabetes Institute in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, told me. In some rare cases, people’s weight loss on GLP-1 drugs doesn’t level off. “They just keep losing and keep losing,” Garvey said. “You are losing bone; you’re losing muscle.” Already, people who want to lose weight have some of the most powerful tools ever available. In the next year, they’ll likely have even more options.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10164322125524047","likes":2,"shares":0,"comments":0,"views":0,"text_altered":"Whoa-zempic! ​ The next wave of obesity drugs is pushing the limits of weight loss.

Since GLP-1 drugs have been widely available, people have used them not just to tend to their health but also to modify their appearance. Christoffer Clemmensen, an obesity researcher at the University of Copenhagen, drew a parallel between the excessive use of weight-loss medications and inappropriate uses of anabolic steroids to bulk up muscles. Without support from a doctor or other medical professionals, people using these drugs, or even more effective ones, could lose significant muscle mass, Michael Lyon, the medical director of the Obesity Medicine and Diabetes Institute in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, told me. In some rare cases, people’s weight loss on GLP-1 drugs doesn’t level off. “They just keep losing and keep losing,” Garvey said. “You are losing bone; you’re losing muscle.” Already, people who want to lose weight have some of the most powerful tools ever available. In the next year, they’ll likely have even more options."}

Famke Janssen on Amsterdam Empire and recording that catchy 'Forever Pour Toujours' music video: 'It was tough' The \"X-Men\" and \"GoldenEye\" alum talks all about \"Forever Pour Toujours,\" her catchy single she recorded for the Dutch Netflix drama. By Nick Romano Nick Romano is a senior editor at ** with 15 years of journalism experience covering entertainment. His work previously appeared in *Vanity Fair*, Vulture, IGN, and more. EW's editorial guidelines October 30, 2025 2:33 p.m. ET Leave a Comment Famke Janssen as Betty Jonkers on 'Amsterdam Empire'. Credit: - Famke Janssen is now, basically, a pop star, having recorded a professional single and music video for the Dutch Netflix drama *Amsterdam Empire*. - The actress talks about how \"tough\" it was to train in singing and dancing to pull it off. - \"Betty is so unapologetically who she is,\" she says of her character. \"Pour toujours, pour toujours / Forever pour toujours.\" The song is such an earworm, you'll likely hum it to yourself in the days after watching Netflix's *Amsterdam Empire*, a new Dutch drama starring Famke Janssen. The actress of *X-Men*, *Taken*, and *GoldenEye* portrays Betty Jonkers, marking her first time acting in Dutch since leaving the Netherlands to pursue modeling in her teens. Story wise, this ex-pop diva is out to steal her former husband's thriving marijuana coffee shop business after he left her for a younger woman he impregnated. Among Betty's claims to fame is a hit 1990s single called \"Forever Pour Toujours.\" Janssen and Netherlands-based musician Palmbomen (a.k.a. Kai Hugo) professionally recorded and released the song through Netflix music. The star then also shot a music video. \"Isn't it so catchy? It's hilarious, I know,\" Janssen tells **. \"While we were filming, I was being trained for singing and dancing to make the video. And I kept pushing it, going, 'I'm so busy. Can we do it at the end of the shoot?' I thought, 'I need more time.' I love to dance. Trust me, it's one of my hobbies, but I've never been trained.\" Betty Jonkers (Famke Janssen) rolls up to the Amsterdam Music Awards on 'Amsterdam Empire'. She also doesn't consider herself a professional singer, even though \"Forever Pour Toujours\" is now on Apple Music and Spotify. She remembers, however, singing karaoke with the cast of *X-Men*, including James Marsden, who played Cyclops to her Jean Grey and previously commented on his costar's \"beautiful\" singing voice. Janssen remembers being in Tokyo with Marsden and his wife, Lisa Linde, where they would hit the karaoke bars. \"I'm not speaking out of turn, she knew this: She had a terrible voice, he had the most incredible voice,\" she recalls. \"They would do duets together and stuff like that. It was hilarious. But I've always been incredibly intimidated by singing.\" Famke Janssen details her struggles with fame: 'The press always wins' James Marsden calls 'Avengers: Doomsday' return a homecoming to 'X-Men' role She worked with choreographer Vincent Vianen, whom she describes as \"meticulous\" with the '90s-inspired movements. \"It was tough. He had to be tough on me and he had to be very strict and firm,\" Janssen says. \"I practiced. All day, whenever I was on set, people would see me in the background doing small moves.\" The Running Man was one such dance move she had to learn, since the video took inspiration from '90s hip-hop. \"We started doing it on a slower speed in the beginning,\" she remembers. \"Just try to do the Running Man. Do it at normal speed and then do it at the speed of the song [\"Forever Pour Toujours\"]. It was a challenge, but I did it.\" Famke Janssen on 'Amsterdam Empire'. The tone of *Amsterdam Empire* is an enjoyable concoction of *Breaking Bad*-esque drama (instead of blue meth, it's weed) but also *Real Housewives*-level camp. In one of her more soapy, theatrical moments, Janssen's Betty arrives by boat to the Amsterdam Music Awards to upend a big work moment for her ex's new lover.

EW's editorial guidelines October 30, 2025 2:33 p.m. ET Leave a Comment Famke Janssen as Betty Jonkers on 'the Dutch Netflix drama'. Credit: - Famke Janssen is now, basically, a pop star, having recorded a professional single and music video for the Dutch Netflix drama *the Dutch Netflix drama*. - The actress talks about how \"tough\" it was to train in singing and dancing to pull it off. - \"Betty is so unapologetically who she is,\" she says of her character. \"Pour toujours, pour toujours / Forever pour toujours.\" The song is such an earworm, you'll likely hum it to yourself in the days after watching Netflix's *the Dutch Netflix drama*, a new Dutch drama starring Famke Janssen. The actress of *the superhero franchise*, *Taken*, and *the James Bond film franchise* portrays Betty Jonkers, marking her first time acting in Dutch since leaving the Netherlands to pursue modeling in her teens. Story wise, this ex-pop diva is out to steal her former husband's thriving marijuana coffee shop business after he left her for a younger woman he impregnated. Among Betty's claims to fame is a hit 1990s single called \"Forever Pour Toujours.\" Janssen and Netherlands-based musician Palmbomen (a.k.a. Kai Hugo) professionally recorded and released the song through Netflix music. The star then also shot a music video. \"Isn't it so catchy? It's hilarious, I know,\" Janssen tells **. \"While we were filming, I was being trained for singing and dancing to make the video. And I kept pushing it, going, 'I'm so busy. Can we do it at the end of the shoot?' I thought, 'I need more time.' I love to dance. Trust me, it's one of my hobbies, but I've never been trained.\" Betty Jonkers (Famke Janssen) rolls up to the Amsterdam Music Awards on 'the Dutch Netflix drama'. She also doesn't consider herself a professional singer, even though \"Forever Pour Toujours\" is now on Apple Music and Spotify. She remembers, however, singing karaoke with the cast of *the superhero franchise*, including James Marsden, who played Cyclops to her Jean Grey and previously commented on his costar's \"beautiful\" singing voice. Janssen remembers being in Tokyo with Marsden and his wife, Lisa Linde, where they would hit the karaoke bars. \"I'm not speaking out of turn, she knew this: She had a terrible voice, he had the most incredible voice,\" she recalls. \"They would do duets together and stuff like that. It was hilarious. But I've always been incredibly intimidated by singing.\" Famke Janssen details her struggles with fame: 'The press always wins' James Marsden calls 'Avengers: Doomsday' return a homecoming to 'the superhero franchise' role She worked with choreographer Vincent Vianen, whom she describes as \"meticulous\" with the '90s-inspired movements. \"It was tough. He had to be tough on me and he had to be very strict and firm,\" Janssen says. \"I practiced. All day, whenever I was on set, people would see me in the background doing small moves.\" The Running Man was one such dance move she had to learn, since the video took inspiration from '90s hip-hop. \"We started doing it on a slower speed in the beginning,\" she remembers. \"Just try to do the Running Man. Do it at normal speed and then do it at the speed of the song [\"Forever Pour Toujours\"]. It was a challenge, but I did it.\" Famke Janssen on 'the Dutch Netflix drama'. The tone of *the Dutch Netflix drama* is an enjoyable concoction of *Breaking Bad*-esque drama (instead of blue meth, it's weed) but also *Real Housewives*-level camp. In one of her more soapy, theatrical moments, Janssen's Betty arrives by boat to the Amsterdam Music Awards to upend a big work moment for her ex's new lover. Nico Moolenaar, Bart Uytdenhouwen, and Piet Matthys created *the Dutch Netflix drama*, which Janssen also executive produces with Moolenaar.

Most people see problems. Lillian Moller Gilbreth saw systems waiting to be perfected. Born in 1878 in Oakland, California, Lillian was the eldest of nine children—shy, brilliant, and hungry for knowledge in an era that told women their minds were decorative. Her father believed college was wasted on daughters. She proved him spectacularly wrong. By 1900, she had graduated from UC Berkeley. Then earned a master's in literature. Then, in 1915, she completed her PhD in psychology from Brown University—becoming one of the first women in America to earn a doctorate, at a time when most universities wouldn't even admit women. But Lillian didn't pursue psychology to analyze emotions. She wanted to understand human motion, efficiency, and dignity in work. She married Frank Gilbreth, a self-taught engineer as restless and innovative as she was. Together, they became pioneers of motion study—the science of making work faster, safer, and more humane. While Frank timed workers with stopwatches, Lillian watched their faces, their posture, their exhaustion. She asked the question few male engineers considered: Can work be made kinder? They filmed workers performing tasks frame by frame, identified inefficiencies, and created \"therbligs\"—17 fundamental motions that comprise all human labor. Their methods transformed factories, hospitals, and eventually homes across America. They wrote books, lectured internationally, and raised twelve children. Their household became a working laboratory—later immortalized in the book and film \"Cheaper by the Dozen.\" Then, in 1924, tragedy struck. Frank died suddenly of a heart attack at age 55. Lillian was 46, with eleven children still at home and a career the industrial world refused to recognize without her husband's name attached. Clients canceled contracts. Factory doors closed. The engineering establishment dismissed her—woman, widow, mother—as unqualified. She could have retreated into grief and motherhood. Instead, she reinvented herself. If men wouldn't hire her for their factories, she would redesign their world anyway—starting with the spaces they'd never bothered to study: homes. Lillian interviewed over 4,000 women to understand their daily labor. What she discovered was revolutionary: kitchens were designed by men who had never cooked a meal in their lives. So she redesigned them with scientific precision. She pioneered the work triangle concept and advocated for optimal counter heights based on human ergonomics. She created the mobile workstation and pushed for better-designed kitchen tools that reduced repetitive strain. She studied how homemakers moved through their days and eliminated thousands of unnecessary steps. Her insights influenced refrigerator design, including interior organization. While specific inventions like the foot-pedal trash can are sometimes attributed to her (though documentation is unclear), her broader impact is undeniable: she transformed domestic work from invisible drudgery into a field worthy of engineering excellence. But Lillian's legacy extends far beyond kitchens. In 1935, she became the first female engineering professor at Purdue University. She advised multiple U.S. Presidents on workplace efficiency and rehabilitation. She consulted for General Electric, Macy's, and Johnson & Johnson. During World War II, she helped design workspaces accessible for disabled veterans. She worked into her eighties, earned over 20 honorary degrees, became the first woman elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and received the prestigious Hoover Medal for distinguished public service. Her philosophy was elegantly simple: \"Good design should serve people. Efficiency should reduce suffering, not increase it.\" Lillian Moller Gilbreth didn't just study work—she humanized it. She proved that engineering without empathy is incomplete. That efficiency means nothing if it breaks the people performing the labor. That a woman with a PhD and twelve children could reshape American industry precisely because she understood both intellect and care. She was called \"the mother of modern management\" and \"the first lady of engineering.\" But perhaps her greatest achievement was this: she refused to let the world's limitations become her own. When doors closed, she built new ones. When her expertise was dismissed, she found new problems to solve. When widowhood could have ended her career, she made it her launching point. Lillian Moller Gilbreth had 12 children and a brilliant mind—and she used both to prove that genius doesn't require choosing between family and achievement. It requires refusing to accept that you must.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/727295390418497","likes":66,"shares":14,"comments":3,"views":0,"text_altered":"She had 12 children and a PhD—when widowhood threatened to end her career, she revolutionized how America worked, one brilliant insight at a time.

Another review noted that for brand-name drugs, U.S. prices can be ~3 to 4 times higher than in Canada (or higher, depending on the specific drug). For example: Eliquis (a blood thinner) costs in the U.S. ~$1,668 for 180 tablets, while in Canada the lowest listed price was ~$370. Jardiance (for diabetes) cost ~$1,845 in the U.S. for 90 tablets versus ~$290 in Canada. An analysis found that Rinvoq (for Crohn’s/ulcerative colitis) is ~$11,915 in the U.S. vs ~$1,749.95 in Canada — roughly 7× the Canadian price. ⚠️ Examples of drugs with large U.S.–Canada price gaps Eliquis: ~4.5× higher in the U.S. vs Canada. Jardiance: ~6×+ higher in the U.S. vs Canada. Rinvoq: ~7× higher. In a broader list: Latuda (an antipsychotic) 90 tablets cost ~$4,628 in U.S., ~$520 in Canada (~89 % cheaper in Canada). Synthroid (for hypothyroidism) cost ~$114 in U.S. vs ~$44 in Canada (≈ 160 % higher in U.S.) in one older study. 🧠 Why does this happen? Canada uses government regulation and negotiation to constrain prices for patented drugs; the U.S. historically has fewer nationwide restrictions on drug manufacturer pricing. Brand-name drugs (patented) show the largest price gaps; generics often have smaller or even reversed differences. A study found that in 2017 the U.S. spent US $2,497 per person on health-care administrative costs, compared with US $551 per person in Canada. That’s more than 4× the Canadian per-capita amount. The source pointed out that if the U.S. reduced administrative costs to Canadian levels, it could potentially save over US $600 billion annually. Interpretation: A large chunk of U.S. spending is not directly care for patients, but overhead, billing, management, insurer profits, etc. 🔍 Example 2: Overall Spending and Payments to Providers The U.S. spends roughly twice as much per person as “peer” countries (including Canada) when it comes to health care. Much of the difference comes from higher payments to hospitals, physicians, and higher prices for services — not necessarily more services. For example: A source reports that the U.S. was spending ~16.8% of GDP on healthcare vs Canada’s ~10.8% (in one comparison) with the U.S. per-person cost at ~US $10,948 vs Canada ~US $5,370. 🔍 Example 3: Drug Pricing & Provider Mark-Ups While this example is more indirect, a recent report by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that U.S. pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) marked up prices of specialty generic drugs by thousands of percent between 2017-2022, leading to multi-billion-dollar gains. Higher negotiated prices, mark-ups, and less regulation in the U.S. contribute to higher profits in the supply chain. 🔍 Why This Shows Higher Profits (and Costs) If administrative/overhead costs are dramatically higher in the U.S., that means a larger portion of healthcare dollars is going to management, insurers, bureaucratic functions, profit margins — rather than directly to clinical care. Higher per-person payments to hospitals and physicians suggest that U.S. providers can charge (and are paid) more for the same or similar services. Higher drug mark-ups and profit-oriented structures in the U.S. supply chain mean more of the spending ends up as profit (or margin) rather than being passed on in lower consumer/patient cost. When you combine these factors, you end up with a system where expenditures are high, yet outcomes (on many measures) are not better (and in some cases worse) compared to Canada. For instance, Canada often achieves similar or better outcomes at lower cost. ✅ Summary Yes — there is strong evidence that the U.S. healthcare system enables higher profits and overheads (for insurers, administrators, providers) compared to Canada, which contributes to the much higher cost burden on U.S. patients and payers.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/122299776098207946","likes":10,"shares":5,"comments":2,"views":100,"text_altered":"Healthcare in costs in America is a tragedy 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 A U.S. government study found that in 2022, U.S. drug prices were on average ~229 % of Canadian prices (i.e., Canadian prices were about 44 % of what Americans paid) for the same drugs.

Now I’m trying to clean up my account. The photo shows all the sell orders I just placed to be executed at market open Monday. After these are executed, the remaining positions left in my account would be: AAPL AMZN CAVA COST GOOGL LLY MSFT NVDA SHOP SOXX etf VB etf VOO etf I’m on the fence about whether to sell SHOP and CAVA. My plan is to focus on making ETFs the core of my account (right now they only make up 12%). I am thinking of adding QQQM and META. Thoughts on these decisions: was it a good move to fire my financial advisor? Are there any positions I’ve got sell orders for I should keep? Any positions I’m keeping that I should dump? Anything I’m missing but should add? I’m 33 years old and don’t plan to touch this account until I’m 59.5. I max out my account every year. Still relatively new to investing and would appreciate any advice.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1838685147006897","likes":314,"shares":23,"comments":330,"views":0}

Halda’s once-daily prostate-cancer drug is designed to dodge resistance issues (a big challenge in later-stage treatments), and J&J gets another tool for its growing oncology lineup. There’s a small EPS dip next year, but the long-term upside could be real. It’s a “think long-term” kind of deal. Do you see this as the right next step for J&J’s long-term strategy?

Mine was discovered during a routine dr visit in Sept. I was diagnosed with SVT and underwent an unsuccessful ablation in early 2020. I never had any symptoms and if not for my Apple Watch sending me alerts as my heart rate climbed to 200+,I would not have known. At the time of the ER visit for SVT the medical team stopped and restarted my heart with Adenisine. I was put on Metoprolol Tartrate which I stayed on for 5 years. I had sporadic short episodes of rapid heart rate that would go back to normal so did not think much about it when I started getting AFib alerts earlier this year on my watch. I also have a Kardia Mobile device and looking back at the history it appears I have been in persistent AFib since Jan or Feb. I had no symptoms. Fast forward to Sept 2025. I saw a new cardiologist as I now reside in a different state. She put me on Nebivilol and Eliquis and stopped Metoprolol. I’ve had a Nuclear Stress Test, a Carotid Artery Scan, an Echocardiogram, and a Sleep Study. All showed no issues. I had an unsuccessful Cardioversion last Thursday (SR was not able to be restored) and was put on Flecainide afterwards. As of this morning I am still in AFib and seeing cardiologist at noon today. My resting heart rate is around 62 and my blood pressure is good. BPM range from 50 to 85 most days. I’m guessing she will increase the dosage of Flecainide. FYI, I am 69 years old. Being overweight seems to be the only trigger I have as I do not smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine. I have made an appt with an EP on 12/23. I’m not exactly happy with my current cardiologist as her office feels like an assembly line. I am feeling out of breath from the drugs and pretty stressed out right now.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10163315888687733","likes":5,"shares":0,"comments":39,"views":0}

While both are flagship devices, they take distinct approaches in hardware, software, and user experience. Performance & Hardware: The S24 Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, paired with 12 GB of RAM, ensuring smooth multitasking, gaming, and creative work. It can handle heavy apps, high-resolution media editing, and demanding games effortlessly. In contrast, the iPhone 17 Pro Max runs on Apple’s A19 Pro chip, which leads in single-core CPU performance and optimized software integration. This makes the iPhone slightly superior for raw processing speed, gaming efficiency, and long-term software optimization. Both devices offer large storage options, with the S24 Ultra supporting up to 1 TB, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max up to 2 TB, catering to power users who store large media files or apps. Display & Design: Both phones feature large displays with high refresh rates. The S24 Ultra boasts a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with QHD+ resolution and an adaptive 1–120 Hz refresh rate, delivering sharp visuals, deep blacks, and excellent brightness even under sunlight. Its titanium frame adds durability and premium feel. The iPhone 17 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with ProMotion up to 120 Hz and an Always-On display. Apple’s display emphasizes color accuracy and smooth animations. Both phones are IP68-rated, providing dust and water resistance. Cameras: Camera capabilities are a key differentiator. The S24 Ultra features a quad-camera setup: a 200 MP main sensor, a 50 MP ultra-wide, a 50 MP periscope 5× telephoto, and a 10 MP 3× telephoto lens, along with a 12 MP front camera. Samsung emphasizes versatility, AI-assisted image enhancement, and zoom capabilities.

It's a positive move, don't get me wrong, but honestly, they shouldn't have put those kinds of social issues on the calendar to begin with. Topics like this are the responsibility of parents to teach their children about at home, with no place in our public school system. It seems like they're trying to ease the tension from all the feedback, but it doesn't undo the mix-up and frustration it sparked.

I'm sure that you remember doing that over your newborn. I never dreamed that I'd do that over my husband, but here we are. It doesn't mean that I doubt God. That's the one thing I've never done, not ever, not once, since I committed to Him as a very young teen. But even the most glorious human beings in the world sometimes are taken before it's what we humans consider his or her time. God doesn't promise us that we'll have each other for all of our years together here on earth. He promises to be with us, no matter what happens, and I know that to be true. I can't imagine going through this without Him, but I, too, can't imagine seeing a perfect sunrise (or sunset) without Him, nor hearing a baby giggle, nor see the \"light\" go off in a child as they finally understand what has been being taught to them...I can't imagine one single moment of life without Him in it! His guidance, His comfort, His chiding when needed...I can't imagine life without Him. As you navigate your way through this Season of Love, I truly, with all my heart, pray that you have Him holding you, wrapping you in His love (and all that goes with His unconditional love), every single moment of every single day of your lives. We both thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for the prayers that you've so diligently said for Ken through this journey that we've been on since June, and that ramped up SO much when he was admitted first to UMMC, then transferred to Buffalo General. He was admitted on 10/16, surgery (postponed due to him taking Eliquis in UMMC, which was the right call to treat what they had information about - AFib) was 10/27, and he was released on 10/31, a total, including partial days for admission and release, of 16 days. Your prayers during that time, and every day since he returned home, have been priceless. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!! We can never repay you for your kindness, but we DO hope that you know just how much we appreciate you for your selflessness.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10240584628459096","likes":20,"shares":0,"comments":38,"views":0}

I have summarised and simplified the paper attached for ease of consumption: The mechanism of ‘traditional’ vaccines consists in inoculating viruses, which have been previously inactivated (e.g. by thermal treatments), or attenuated (e.g. by multiple passages in suboptimal growth conditions). Such viruses, which lost the ability to cause acute infection, allow the immune system to recognize them as exogenous pathogens, promoting the production of specific antibodies and memory-T lymphocytes which will kill the virus. On the contrary, the genetic vaccines against COVID-19 induce human cells to produce the spike protein, producing an autoimmune reaction against all the cells that intake the genetic material and start the protein synthesis. (This is what experts call VAIDS - Vaccine Aquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.) As concerns the Covid vaccine, it is injected into the deltoid muscle, which drains primarily to the axillary lymph nodes. Theoretically, the lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in which the mRNA is encapsulated, should have a very restricted biodistribution; injected in the deltoid muscle which primarily drains to the axillary lymph nodes. However, a pharmacokinetic study performed by Pfizer for the Japanese regulatory agency shows that the LNPs display an off-target distribution on rodents, accumulating in organs such as the spleen, liver, pituitary gland, thyroid, ovaries and in other tissues. Similarly, the results of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessment reports show an off-target distribution of the LNPs used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, in the liver and other organs of rodents. In conclusion, it is essential to underline that every human cell that intakes the LNPs and translates and expresses the viral protein is inevitably recognized as a threat by the immune system and killed. There are no exceptions to this mechanism. The severity of the resulting damage and the consequences for health depend on the quantity of the cells involved, on the type of tissue and on the strength of the following autoimmune reaction.

Gavin Newsom didn’t ease into his monologue — he dove straight at House Speaker Mike Johnson and D.o.n.a.l.d T.r.u.m.p with a fiery segment that immediately sent political circles into chaos. His target?

That moment marked the real kick-off of my career in the Data Management field. I was 27 years old, working at ITWorx, when I got the opportunity to join an on-premises BI project for Pfizer. I was still a junior back then — eager, curious, and NERVOUS — but that project became the foundation of everything that followed in my professional journey. Back then, all my knowledge was purely theoretical. No SQL. No Data Warehousing awareness. Didn’t even know what ETL stood for or how it was applied. Not to mention OLAP Cubes, Reporting Tools, and all the rest. I still remember the day I was asked to write my first SQL command. It was on that same project — when the Country Manager asked me to run a sanity check on some data. And I thought to myself: “Oh God, he’s gonna find out that I’m a fraud.” I honestly don’t know how I powered through that phase. I just vividly remember spending days and nights reading about database design, ETL tools, reporting, and data architecture — trying to connect theory to reality. But there was a learning curve — and it paid off. That project became the stage for some of my proudest early achievements. During my 2.5 years at Pfizer, I optimized the data lifecycle workflow (from source systems to reporting tools), reducing refresh time from 14 hours to just 2 hours. Applied a manual MDM solution across multiple major systems. And supported reporting across the entire AFME region (Africa & Middle East). I consider myself lucky to have started my BI career when the BI was truly traditional and end-to-end — before heavy specialization. I got to do it all: Data Architecture, Data Modeling, ETL, Data Quality, BI & Analytics, Insights, and even a little bit of Data Science. Later, when I shifted more toward the business side as a Business Analyst in Data Management, I discovered my true passion and soft spot — being the bridge between the business and the technical worlds, speaking each one’s language. That solid technical start as a BI Developer opened amazing doors for me — to work as Business Analyst at CIB Egypt, Teradata, and Banque Misr بنك مصر. And for that, I’m truly thankful. And above all, I also consider myself extremely lucky and blessed to have learned from some of the best in the industry: Nedaa Agami, Sherif Isaac, Amr Ashmawy, Amirah Elsabagh, Heba Zaied, Walied Ebrahiem, Ahmed Emad, Diaa El-Bagouri, Tamer ElHossiny, Sherif Anwar, Karim Khalifa, Shaimaa El-Gammal, Gihan Mahmoud, Ahmed ElKhayal, Omar Maher, Mike Bellhouse, and many many more. (I don't wanna forget anyone, and sorry if i did) Thank you all for shaping my journey and helping me grow. I’m genuinely grateful for every lesson, every challenge, and every opportunity that brought me here 🙏 Here’s to the next ten years — of learning, building, and sharing back with the community.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/24702262696062646","likes":27,"shares":0,"comments":20,"views":0}

In 2025, with all the information the world has given us… With all the children who have died from diseases we can prevent with a simple shot… There are still parents proudly avoiding immunization. And that scared me. Because the truth is simple: 👉🏽 The risk of not giving immunization is far greater than the risk of giving it. Diseases don’t ask for your permission before attacking a child. And prevention has always been kinder than cure. The same thing happened when I posted about HPV vaccination. A pastor dropped a comment saying the vaccine was “a lie from the pit of hell.” I deleted it… but it stayed with me. Because some people forget that others actually listen to them. Some people forget the weight their words carry. And some public voices speak before they research, leaving innocent people to carry the consequences.

HIS GOAL'S BEYOND! ■‘BBC bias’ memo was written by American pharma lobbyist ■A guest post from Sam Bright. Dr Julia Grace Patterson💙 Nov 16, 2025 'My name is Sam Bright – I’m an investigative journalist and Substacker focused on exposing the populist elite (especially Nigel Farage and his cronies). Julia has been kind enough to share her platform with me, so I can tell you a worrying and important story about the author of the memo that blew up the BBC this week. Subscribe to Sam's Substack SPOILER ALERT - NOT JUST ABOUT A CLIMSY BBC EDIT: 'You probably all know the key developments, but I will recap them quickly in case you haven’t been following the gory details. ■Last week, a critical review of the BBC’s editorial policies was leaked to The Telegraph. It revealed how Panorama botched an edit of Donald Trump’s speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021. ■Regardless of how the speech was edited, Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol, which left 174 police officers injured and lawmakers fleeing for their lives. ■However, the Panorama edit was clumsy at best, carelessly stitching together different sections of Trump’s speech. It was shoddy journalism. This scandal has snowballed – with The Telegraph and other populist reactionaries mounting an aggressive campaign to defenestrate our public broadcaster (despite The Telegraph’s own extensive record of editorial f*ck-ups). The BBC’s director-general has resigned, as has the CEO of BBC News, while Trump is threatening to sue the corporation for $1 billion. BUT JUST WHO IS MICHAEL PRESCOTT? But let’s go back to the beginning. The memo that kicked off this whole journalistic psychodrama was authored by Michael Prescott under his former capacity as an external adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee. ■He is reportedly friends with Robbie Gibb, the BBC board member widely considered to be a Tory sleeper agent within the corporation. As has been extensively documented, Gibb (appointed to the board by Boris Johnson) was the director of communications for Theresa May when she was prime minister. He has described himself as a “proper Thatcherite Conservative”. ■Aside from having questionable friendships, Prescott is a corporate lobbyist. ■He’s the managing director of Hanover Communications – and his clients make for pretty grim reading. ■Chief among them is the American Pharmaceutical Group, which represents 10 of the largest U.S. pharma companies with a presence in the UK: AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Incyte, Gilead, J&J Innovative Medicine, Lilly, MSD, and Vertex. ■Official records show that Hanover has lobbied the Labour government on behalf of these companies over the course of the past few months. At the same time – and perhaps with Prescott’s help – American pharma giants have been pressuring (bullying is possibly a more accurate description) the government to open up the NHS to these corporate healthcare predators. ■As reported by Politico last week, American pharma giants have threatened to leave the UK if the NHS doesn’t pay more for their drugs. Eli Lilly – another one of Hanover’s clients – has said that it wants to see “significant and sustainable” change in the NHS before restarting its investment in a biotech incubator project. This threat has been echoed by Trump, who appears to have successfully lobbied for the NHS to pay 25% more for American medicines – accusing other countries of “freeloading” on his country’s pharma sector. Indeed, Trump is Big Pharma’s biggest champion – despite its decades-long record of fleecing, exploiting, and sometimes killing the American public. Why? Money, of course. Pharma companies donated an estimated $5 million to his re-election campaign and several million to his inauguration ceremony. Like so many other toxic, corrupt industries, they’ve bought their way into the president’s good books. ■At the top of this list is Big Tech, which has an incestuous relationship with Trump, a man who has become a battering ram for the interests of Silicon Valley tech bros and their virulent algorithms. ■Who else is on Hanover’s client list? You guessed it – Big Tech companies. Prescott’s firm lobbies for Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, and Apple – all of which have given millions of dollars to Trump in one form or another. ■■This complicates Prescott’s role in the BBC saga. It could well be argued that his firm stands to benefit from destabilising the UK’s relationship with Trump, knowing that the UK government may seek to offer concessions to American industries in exchange for the president dropping his lawsuit against the BBC. ■■We don’t know these were Prescott’s motives (neither he nor Hanover responded to my requests for comment), but this story is certainly not the simple tale presented by the right-wing press, of an independent, impartial observer sharing his concerns about the BBC’s editorial failures. Rather, by virtue of his mega-money American clients, Michael Prescott has a lot of skin in this game – a fact that should be a lot more widely understood.

HIS GOAL'S BEYOND! ■‘BBC bias’ memo was written by American pharma lobbyist ■A guest post from Sam Bright. Dr Julia Grace Patterson💙 Nov 16, 2025 'My name is Sam Bright – I’m an investigative journalist and Substacker focused on exposing the populist elite (especially Nigel Farage and his cronies). Julia has been kind enough to share her platform with me, so I can tell you a worrying and important story about the author of the memo that blew up the BBC this week. Subscribe to Sam's Substack SPOILER ALERT - NOT JUST ABOUT A CLIMSY BBC EDIT: 'You probably all know the key developments, but I will recap them quickly in case you haven’t been following the gory details. ■Last week, a critical review of the BBC’s editorial policies was leaked to The Telegraph. It revealed how Panorama botched an edit of Donald Trump’s speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021. ■Regardless of how the speech was edited, Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol, which left 174 police officers injured and lawmakers fleeing for their lives. ■However, the Panorama edit was clumsy at best, carelessly stitching together different sections of Trump’s speech. It was shoddy journalism. This scandal has snowballed – with The Telegraph and other populist reactionaries mounting an aggressive campaign to defenestrate our public broadcaster (despite The Telegraph’s own extensive record of editorial f*ck-ups). The BBC’s director-general has resigned, as has the CEO of BBC News, while Trump is threatening to sue the corporation for $1 billion. BUT JUST WHO IS MICHAEL PRESCOTT? But let’s go back to the beginning.

($MRK) is one of the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies, driven by a strong portfolio in oncology, vaccines, immunology, and infectious diseases.\nIts revenue model is powered by patent-protected drugs, global vaccine distribution, next gen pipeline development, and strategic partnerships.\n\nUnlike high volatility tech or AI assets, $MRK represents a defensive, fundamentals-driven investment, backed by decades of medical innovation and steady cash flow.\n\nStrengths\n\n1. Dominance in Oncology KEYTRUDA as a Mega Blockbuster\n\nKEYTRUDA remains one of the best-selling cancer therapies globally and is projected to continue strong growth due to new indications and expanded global approvals.\nThis drug alone anchors a significant portion of MRK’s revenue and pipeline stability.\n\n2. Diverse & High Conviction Pipeline\n\nMRK is reinforcing its pipeline in:\n• Oncology\n• Vaccines (e.g., HPV, RSV)\n• Cardiometabolic disease\n• Immunology\n\nPipeline expansion and late-stage studies offer major upside catalysts.\n\n3. Strong Vaccine Franchise\n\nMRK’s vaccines generate predictable recurring revenue and maintain global demand, acting as a stabilizing segment during economic downturns.\n\n4. Financial Durability\n\nThe company has healthy cash reserves, consistent free cash flow, and the ability to reinvest aggressively into R&D and M&A.\n\n5. Global Scale & Market Penetration\n\nMRK operates across major markets worldwide, benefiting from diversified geographic exposure.\n\nRisks / Headwinds\n\n1.

Calls me every hour, as he feels stronger, then weaker, then frightened, then better., even hopeful!…for the next 24 hours. He asks me to make some phone calls for him with instructions, and I do.

Midnight on a Sunday, I text I’ll be up for a while longer, just shutting my eyes for a bit — but repeating that I’m right here, to let me know what he needs, to call no matter the time. At 4:38 a.m., the flip-phone I have up under my heart, rings. “Stay with me, don’t leave.” Of course. Then, a raspy: “Talk. About anything.

About how his books and essays have restructured truth-telling in the academic medical field in the last five years. Read to him from “The Pfizer Papers” we had previously both bought and devoured.

Former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi is set to meet the Italian President Sergio Mattarella later Wednesday with a view to heading up a government of national unity, something that would end the latest political crisis in Rome.

Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stock added 3.9% after the diabetes drug maker gave upbeat sales and profit forecasts for 2021, while Swedish truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) stock rose 0.3% after raising its forecasts for some of its main markets and rolling out a hefty shareholder payout.

He played Omar Little on the HBO drama series The Wire from 2002 to 2008 and Albert \"Chalky\" White on the HBO series Boardwalk Empire from 2010 to 2014. He earned Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performances in the HBO television biopic Bessie (2015), the Netflix drama series When They See Us (2019), and the HBO series The Night Of (2016) and Lovecraft Country (2020). He had a recurring role in the sitcom Community from 2011 to 2012. He also had supporting roles in a number of films including Gone Baby Gone (2006), The Road (2009), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Inherent Vice (2014), and Motherless Brooklyn (2019). Williams was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of a Bahamian mother from Nassau and Booker T. Williams, an American, from Greeleyville, South Carolina, where his African-American family has deep roots. Williams was raised in the Vanderveer Projects in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School. According to a DNA analysis, he was descended partly from the Mende people of Sierra Leone. After getting into trouble as a youth, he enrolled at the National Black Theatre in New York City. Williams worked for Pfizer pharmaceuticals as a temp. However, inspired by Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, he left school and quit his job, against the wishes of his family, to pursue a career as a dancer. During a year in which he was intermittently homeless, Williams visited record labels and dance studios looking for work. He got a job as a background dancer with singer Kym Sims, which led to more work appearing as a dancer in music videos and on tours with artists such as George Michael and Madonna, as well as some modeling work. He also choreographed Crystal Waters' 1994 single \"100% Pure Love\". Williams had a large facial scar he received in a bar fight on Jamaica Avenue, New York City, on his 25th birthday, when he was slashed with a razor blade. The scar became his signature feature, and resulted in offers to perform as a thug in music videos, and modeling opportunities with noted photographers like David LaChapelle. One of his first acting roles was alongside Tupac Shakur as High Top, the brother and henchman to Shakur's drug kingpin Tank, in the 1996 film Bullet. Shakur reportedly decided on Williams for the role after spotting a polaroid photograph of him in a production studio. Williams also served as the American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador to the Campaign for Smart Justice. Williams' portrayals of openly gay characters was deemed to be revolutionary. Williams gained recognition as an actor for his portrayal of Omar Little in The Wire, which began filming in 2002. The character was based on Donnie Andrews along with other crime figures in Baltimore. Williams received the part after a single audition, at the encouragement of writer Ed Burns. He was told that the character was slated to appear in just seven episodes and expected him to be killed by the end of the first season. However, creator David Simon stated that they always planned to keep the character as part of the continuing ensemble should the show be renewed beyond one season. For his portrayal of Omar, Williams was named by USA Today as one of ten reasons they still love television. Omar was praised for his uniqueness in the stale landscape of TV crime dramas and for the wit and humor that Williams brings to the portrayal. Omar has been named as one of the first season's richest characters, a Robin Hood of Baltimore's west side projects. The Baltimore City Paper named the character one of their top ten reasons not to cancel the show and called him \"arguably the show's single greatest achievement\". In 2007, he was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Omar. Williams pursued the role because he was intrigued by Omar's contradictory nature. He felt Omar's popularity stemmed from his honesty, lack of materialism, individuality and his adherence to his strict code. He felt that the role has been a breakthrough in terms of bringing attention to him and getting further roles. Williams received both positive and negative reactions to Omar's homosexuality and felt that he was successful in challenging attitudes and provoking discussion with the role. In 2008, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama cited The Wire as his favorite television show, and called Omar his favorite character. About Omar, Obama said, \"That's not an endorsement. He's not my favorite person, but he's a fascinating character ... he's the toughest, baddest guy on the show.\" During his portrayal of Omar Little, Williams went by his character's name and developed a habit of smoking cannabis and an addiction to cocaine in 2004. Williams lived part-time in Newark, New Jersey using drugs, but sought help from a ministry in neighboring Irvington, which he credited for helping him during the production. Williams was found dead in his Williamsburg, Brooklyn apartment by his nephew on September 6, 2021. On September 24, 2021, the NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner confirmed that Williams died of a fatal combination of fentanyl, p-fluorofentanyl, heroin and cocaine, and ruled the death as an accidental overdose. His private funeral was held at St. Stephen's Episcopal Cathedral in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where his mother lives.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/773940695688231","likes":14,"shares":5,"comments":14,"views":0,"text_altered":"the American actor known for his roles in HBO series (November 22, 1966 – September 6, 2021) was an American actor.

He also had supporting roles in a number of films including Gone Baby Gone (2006), The Road (2009), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Inherent Vice (2014), and Motherless Brooklyn (2019). Williams was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of a Bahamian mother from Nassau and Booker T. Williams, an American, from Greeleyville, South Carolina, where his African-American family has deep roots. Williams was raised in the Vanderveer Projects in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School. According to a DNA analysis, he was descended partly from the Mende people of Sierra Leone. After getting into trouble as a youth, he enrolled at the National Black Theatre in New York City. Williams worked for the pharmaceutical company he worked for pharmaceuticals as a temp. However, inspired by Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, he left school and quit his job, against the wishes of his family, to pursue a career as a dancer. During a year in which he was intermittently homeless, Williams visited record labels and dance studios looking for work. He got a job as a background dancer with singer Kym Sims, which led to more work appearing as a dancer in music videos and on tours with artists such as George Michael and Madonna, as well as some modeling work. He also choreographed Crystal Waters' 1994 single \"100% Pure Love\". Williams had a large facial scar he received in a bar fight on Jamaica Avenue, New York City, on his 25th birthday, when he was slashed with a razor blade. The scar became his signature feature, and resulted in offers to perform as a thug in music videos, and modeling opportunities with noted photographers like David LaChapelle. One of his first acting roles was alongside Tupac Shakur as High Top, the brother and henchman to Shakur's drug kingpin Tank, in the 1996 film Bullet. Shakur reportedly decided on Williams for the role after spotting a polaroid photograph of him in a production studio. Williams also served as the American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador to the Campaign for Smart Justice. Williams' portrayals of openly gay characters was deemed to be revolutionary. Williams gained recognition as an actor for his portrayal of Omar Little in The Wire, which began filming in 2002. The character was based on Donnie Andrews along with other crime figures in Baltimore. Williams received the part after a single audition, at the encouragement of writer Ed Burns. He was told that the character was slated to appear in just seven episodes and expected him to be killed by the end of the first season. However, creator David Simon stated that they always planned to keep the character as part of the continuing ensemble should the show be renewed beyond one season. For his portrayal of Omar, Williams was named by USA Today as one of ten reasons they still love television. Omar was praised for his uniqueness in the stale landscape of TV crime dramas and for the wit and humor that Williams brings to the portrayal. Omar has been named as one of the first season's richest characters, a Robin Hood of Baltimore's west side projects. The Baltimore City Paper named the character one of their top ten reasons not to cancel the show and called him \"arguably the show's single greatest achievement\". In 2007, he was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Omar. Williams pursued the role because he was intrigued by Omar's contradictory nature. He felt Omar's popularity stemmed from his honesty, lack of materialism, individuality and his adherence to his strict code. He felt that the role has been a breakthrough in terms of bringing attention to him and getting further roles. Williams received both positive and negative reactions to Omar's homosexuality and felt that he was successful in challenging attitudes and provoking discussion with the role. In 2008, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama cited The Wire as his favorite television show, and called Omar his favorite character. About Omar, Obama said, \"That's not an endorsement. He's not my favorite person, but he's a fascinating character ... he's the toughest, baddest guy on the show.\" During his portrayal of Omar Little, Williams went by his character's name and developed a habit of smoking cannabis and an addiction to cocaine in 2004. Williams lived part-time in Newark, New Jersey using drugs, but sought help from a ministry in neighboring Irvington, which he credited for helping him during the production. Williams was found dead in his Williamsburg, Brooklyn apartment by his nephew on September 6, 2021. On September 24, 2021, the NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner confirmed that Williams died of a fatal combination of fentanyl, p-fluorofentanyl, heroin and cocaine, and ruled the death as an accidental overdose. His private funeral was held at St. Stephen's Episcopal Cathedral in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where his mother lives."}

This cancer is now immune to Keytruda, chemo, and may or may not be completely able to use radiation to fight it. We are approved for the next and last available drug at this time and hope to get it started on the 11th but should it fail we are at the mercy of experimental not yet approved meds and hospice for symptoms and just wait until he passes away. This past week we’ve been at Methodist Hospital because the extensive spinal vertebrate cancer tumors are so advanced they are causing spinal cord compression and he cannot feel his legs nor stand and is incontintent and in extremely pain when moved. Today they are starting radiation treatment again and hopefully we will go home by the end of the week but I most certainly will need home health care to pick up the slack for whatever my kids don’t do to help me with. I can’t get the Dr to give me a crystal ball to tell me how much time we have left so keep us in your prayers for peace and acceptance. Please be patient with me as much have 9 foster cats in addition to my own 7 who need me so I am not always so well with remembering things and feel like I put out fires all over as fast as I can.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10236689587873218","likes":2,"shares":0,"comments":45,"views":0}

He was extremely apologetic and could not understand why this has not been brought to his attention so that we could treat the problem back then .

Well it turns out that scan in January actually showed that I had had a stroke caused by a blood clot to my left optical region of my brain. Unfortunately for me, I was not informed that this was the case. And never heard anything until I questioned my doctor today. He was extremely apologetic and could not understand why this has not been brought to his attention so that we could treat the problem back then . As of a result of this negligence I suffered my second stroke which could have been prevented.

I was forced to take the jabs as I was working at Petersfield Town Council which was a Covid vaccination Centre and if I refused, I would not have a job. ￼I am not blaming the council as obviously we was all in the dark at the time. The government have used us as guinea pigs, and that’s a result of it. I have lost my life as I knew it . I want answers and I would like to start up a group to speak to people who have experience￼d similar problems as I have had, and try and make sure this does not happen to anyone else. ￼ ￼ Surly the government should be testing all those that have had these jabs for side effects? The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine (brand name Vaxzevria®) was the primary \"jab that was banned,\" or more accurately, temporarily suspended or limited in use by several countries due to its association with a very rare but serious side effect called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), involving blood clots and low platelet counts.

I’m incredibly tired all the time. My bp has always been low but is now even lower. Am 70, 115 lbs… is 25mg a common maintenance dose? Do people ideally try to take the lowest effective dose?

While both devices are premium flagships, their design philosophies, hardware, and ecosystem integration differ, giving users distinct experiences depending on priorities such as camera performance, software, and productivity. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is powered by Apple’s A19 Pro chip, built on a 3 nm process, offering unmatched single-core and GPU performance. Its tightly integrated iOS 26 optimizes battery efficiency and app responsiveness, making it ideal for gaming, video editing, and professional workflows. The S25 Ultra features the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (or Exynos equivalent depending on region), paired with 12–16 GB RAM. While multi-core performance is strong, Android’s resource management differs from iOS, meaning some efficiency and app optimization advantages lie with the iPhone. Both phones offer up to 1–2 TB storage, though Apple now provides a 2 TB option, appealing to users handling large media files. Both phones feature 6.9-inch displays with 120 Hz refresh rates, but the iPhone 17 Pro Max uses a Super Retina XDR OLED, boasting 3,000 nits peak brightness, making it ideal for outdoor visibility. Samsung’s Dynamic AMOLED LTPO panel, with Gorilla Armor 2 protection and titanium frame, prioritizes durability while delivering vibrant colors. Apple’s Ceramic Shield 2 adds scratch resistance, while Samsung’s design allows slightly more ruggedness. Both devices are IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, ensuring durability for daily use. Camera systems are a major differentiator. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a triple 48 MP setup: main, ultra-wide, and telephoto, with computational photography, ProRAW, and ProRes video recording.

I RANG THE BELL!!! 🎉🔔 Chemo infusion #16 is officially in the books… and it was my LAST ONE!! WaaaaaHoooooo! Praise the Lord for carrying me through and for the incredible medication that has kicked this cancer right in the booty. What a blessing. So… what’s next? Welllllll… the journey continues! I’ll still go in every three weeks for the next six months for Keytruda (it’s an IV infusion). Then on January 8th I’ll have my lumpectomy and lymph node removal. After a little 6-week breather, I’ll start radiation—five days a week for about 5–6 weeks. One step at a time, with God guiding each one. In the meantime, we’re keeping an eye on my thyroid. It decided to shoot way up on my last blood test! So if you see me a bit extra puffy… just know we’re working on it. 😆 My endocrinologist quadrupled my dose—so please send up a big prayer request that everything levels out quickly! Huge shoutout to my Sissy, Andi Oldner, for the gorgeous flowers, and to Marcella Kvick for the delicious dinner and the sweetest Ring-the-Bell gift. I already hung the bell on my Christmas tree—because celebrating miracles is important! And my taveling Lemonade Crew (Cabo this time) thank you Shelley Turner Freese, Carrie Sekul Spencer, and Debbie Ewen for thinking of me while you were having fun!! Love that!! 😭🥰😭🥰 Alex, Rachel and the kids for being here to love and support me!! I love this precious family more than you could know! Zach, my church buddy, sanctuary and so much more!!! Love you so very much! Kaila!! Who flew in on the day of my last infusion for Thanksgiving and was able to be there when I rang the bell! Love this little lady so much! And lastly, Jay who has never missed an infusion date! Sat by my side through it all… I am so thankful and love him. 🥰 I’m getting there, friends and family.

While numerous corporations (such as Johnson & Johnson, Teva, and Endo) have faced lawsuits and settlements for their roles in fueling addiction through misleading promotion and supply chain practices, the most prominent is the Sackler family and their control of Purdue Pharma.\n\nPurdue aggressively promoted OxyContin to physicians, downplaying its addictive potential and encouraging high-dose, long-term prescriptions. Internal documents revealed deceptive tactics, including funding biased research and paying doctors kickbacks. This contributed to a surge in prescriptions—from about 670,000 in 1997 to over 15 million by 2002—driving widespread addiction and the broader opioid epidemic.\n\nThe family reaped billions in dividends from OxyContin sales, which peaked at over $3 billion annually. Estimates suggest they extracted at least $10-13 billion from Purdue between 2008 and 2019 alone, much of it transferred offshore amid growing scrutiny.\n\nA few cases involve founders or executives:\n- John Kapoor and Insys Therapeutics: Kapoor, the founder (not a multi-generational family operation), led aggressive promotion of Subsys (a fentanyl spray), including bribing doctors for prescriptions. Insys paid $225 million in settlements, and Kapoor was convicted of racketeering in 2019, serving prison time. Profits from these tactics contributed to over-prescription of fentanyl products.\n\nBroader industry accountability includes multi-billion-dollar settlements from firms like Johnson & Johnson ($5 billion national settlement) for supplying raw opioid ingredients and deceptive marketing.","language":"en","url":"https://x.com/i/web/status/1993358636131795410","likes":0,"shares":0,"comments":3,"views":135}

The images depict a conceptual Jaguar V-Pace, imagined as a luxury multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) that redefines practicality and elegance through Jaguar’s design philosophy. If Jaguar were to produce such a vehicle, here’s a detailed narrative of how it could be positioned and characterized: Overview and Design Philosophy The Jaguar V-Pace represents a daring expansion of Jaguar’s lineup — a sophisticated, performance-oriented MPV that bridges the gap between a luxury SUV and a grand touring estate. Built on the JLR D7a aluminum-intensive platform, the same architecture underpinning the F-Pace and XF, the V-Pace merges lightness, rigidity, and dynamic balance with family versatility. The design language draws from Jaguar’s latest styling evolution — muscular yet elegantly proportioned, with a long hood, a sweeping roofline, and a gracefully tapered rear. The V-Pace appears more like a \"grand tourer for families\" than a typical people carrier. Exterior Design From the front, the V-Pace wears Jaguar’s signature grille and feline LED headlamps, giving it a confident, assertive stance. Aerodynamic sculpting flows from the hood along taut shoulder lines, emphasizing both strength and elegance. The side profile shows a sleek roofline that subtly arches toward the rear, maintaining a sense of movement even at rest — a hallmark of Jaguar’s “Grace, Space, Pace” ethos. The rear design is distinctly sporty, featuring slender taillights inspired by the F-Type, a subtle roof spoiler, and a quad-exhaust layout that underscores its performance credentials. Chrome accents and flush door handles reinforce its premium British character. The British Racing Green metallic finish shown in the images enhances its aristocratic presence, harmonizing beautifully with the countryside setting — a nod to Jaguar’s heritage of blending performance with refinement. Interior and Cabin Design Inside, the V-Pace offers a sumptuous yet purposeful cabin, balancing contemporary technology with timeless craftsmanship. The interior shown features Windsor leather upholstery in a two-tone mix of Forest Green and Oyster, with precision-stitched detailing, dark walnut veneers, and satin metal trims. The dashboard architecture mirrors that of the XF and F-Pace, with the Pivi Pro infotainment system at the center — a crisp touchscreen interface complemented by physical rotary controls for climate functions. The rotary gear selector rises elegantly from the center console, and the digital instrument cluster provides driver-focused clarity. Seating is arranged in a 2+3+2 configuration, offering true MPV practicality with fold-flat rear rows. Despite its family focus, the driving environment remains distinctly Jaguar: intimate, sporty, and sophisticated. A panoramic glass roof floods the cabin with natural light, while ambient LED lighting sets a refined tone for evening drives. Practical touches like multiple USB-C ports, a cooled glovebox, and configurable storage modules make it an ideal grand tourer for modern families. Powertrains and Performance The V-Pace’s dynamic capability is central to its identity. Two members of the Ingenium engine family power the range: The 2.0-liter AJ200 inline-4 turbo produces 296 hp and 400 Nm of torque, delivering effortless acceleration and refined cruising performance ideal for urban and long-distance travel. For those seeking greater performance, the 3.0-liter AJ300 twin-charged inline-6 — enhanced by a 48V mild-hybrid system — produces 400 hp and 550 Nm of torque, enabling sports sedan levels of responsiveness while maintaining superior fuel economy and lower emissions. Both powertrains are paired with a 9-speed ZF automatic gearbox, renowned for its smoothness and precision. Power is sent to the rear wheels by default, emphasizing traditional Jaguar driving dynamics, while an optional all-wheel-drive system with adaptive torque distribution ensures optimum traction and stability in all conditions. Adaptive Dynamics suspension continuously monitors road conditions and driver inputs, providing a balance between comfort and agility rarely found in MPVs. Technology and Safety The Jaguar V-Pace would serve as a showcase of the brand’s latest innovations. Features such as AI-driven driver assistance, Predictive Energy Optimization, and a full suite of ADAS systems — including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and 360° camera — enhance safety and ease of driving. Jaguar’s InControl suite offers seamless smartphone integration, over-the-air updates, and remote vehicle control via mobile app. Optional rear entertainment screens, Wi-Fi hotspot capability, and a premium 1200W Meridian surround sound system with 18 speakers turn the cabin into a rolling lounge of refinement and connectivity. Driving Experience and Positioning Unlike conventional family movers, the V-Pace would be tuned for dynamic confidence. The low center of gravity, lightweight aluminum structure, and precise steering deliver a level of composure and engagement rare in this segment. It’s an MPV that can whisk a family across the countryside in quiet luxury yet still handle a winding road with the precision expected of a Jaguar. The V-Pace would occupy a unique niche — a luxury performance MPV offering sitting alongside mainstream rivals like the Mercedes-Benz Citan Tourer, yet sportier and more emotionally engaging than the F-Pace or Range Rover. It would appeal to families and professionals seeking space, craftsmanship, and performance without compromise. Narrative Summary In essence, the Jaguar V-Pace reimagines what a luxury MPV can be: elegant, exhilarating, and deeply emotional. It’s a vehicle for those who value both grand touring spirit and everyday practicality, an embodiment of Jaguar’s timeless creed — Grace, Space, Pace — evolved for the modern era of refined versatility.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1377060093815200","likes":72,"shares":3,"comments":5,"views":0,"text_altered":"Should the British luxury car manufacturer make an MPV?

These 5 tend to get the best responses from clients as well. Save this one for when ya need it! 1️⃣ Banded Hip Distraction: If your hips always feel jammed up & tight - you should try this one! The band allows for the hip joint to gap/distract/open up more, so it’s great if your hips are feeling jammed and stiff. I usually start with ~1 minute at a time, but you can really work up to 5 minutes + if you want! 2️⃣ Banded Quad Opener: The bench allows you to fully relax the down leg which will help you get the most out of the stretch. Squeeze the glute to really feel the front of the hip open up! One of my favorites! 3️⃣ Banded Frog Distraction: A great hip opener for before or after your lower body day, or just if the hips fell tight & stiff. Place the band around your waist line, get on all 4s with your toes pointing out, & sink your hips back. Feel free to make it more active by driving the hips forward & then sinking back more, or keep it completely passive & relax! 4️⃣ Banded Elevated Pigeon: One of my favorites! The incline bench allows the knee to fully rest which allows for a better stretch - something we often don’t consider when doing this stretch in other positions. 5️⃣ Banded Hip IR (Supine): A great primer to “grease the groove” before squatting. While you internally rotate your hip, the band will help distract the hip joint to create some space which allows the hip to internally rotate better. Make it active by bringing the hip to neutral then back to IR, hold IR for :30-:60 seconds, etc. Play around with it! Most of these can be done passively or actively. I suggest doing both - but most importantly if you can, follow it up with movements that are typically stiff to see if helps!

She’s talking with the dentist to understand the full extent of the infection and how it might affect Mom’s ability to receive treatment on Monday.

Bristol Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. The visitors spoke to TYs about the career opportunities across multiple functions, including Biologics Manufacturing, External Manufacturing and Commercial. TYs learned that BMS first began operations in Ireland in 1964 with an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Plant (API) in Swords, County Dublin. The current BMS operations in Ireland include a newly constructed state-of-the-art biologics drug-substance manufacturing facility in Cruiserath, Dublin 15 and External Manufacturing divisions in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15 and Shannon, Co. Clare. BMS Ireland employs approximately 650 people. The TYs also learned about the pathways each of the 2 employees went on since college, which was really interesting. The company collaborates with second level institutions, particularly those with a core focus on STEM subjects. Their TY programme is an exciting week-long programme of activity for TY students with an interest in learning more about a career in science, engineering and the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland. A number of TYs have applied for this programme so hopefully a student will get a place. BMS also offer an Apprenticeship Programme designed to offer hands on experience and a robust foundation for individuals eager to embark on a career in the pharmaceutical industry. This is done through structured education, formal training and learning in the workplace. It takes 2 years to complete the Level 6 qualification, with an optional third year for those pursuing a Level 7 qualification. Thanks to Lorraine and Donal for visiting ACS. We really appreciate your time.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1403124498473503","likes":20,"shares":2,"comments":2,"views":0}

This year, Arissa joined the Summit as an AstraZeneca Delegate, part of the organisation’s largest delegation to date—100 leaders, including 12 YHP Impact Fellows and 87 AstraZeneca colleagues from around the world. The Fellowship and Summit provided a critical platform to showcase Malaysia’s community-driven health work and to highlight #JagaJiran, DnG’s flagship community-based Community Health Navigator (CHN) ecosystem. JagaJiran aligns strongly with AstraZeneca’s priorities in youth health and NCD prevention, as well as One Young World’s commitment to scalable, people-centred innovation. Across the week, DnG engaged in discussions on health equity, systems leadership, gender, community resilience, and decentralised care — connecting Malaysia’s on-ground realities with global health agendas. What’s next for DnG: We will be focusing on strengthening and scaling JagaJiran, expanding CHN training pathways, formalising global partnerships, and deepening our research on community health, gender, and NCDs. The goal remains the same: to build a sustainable, community-led ecosystem that ensures care is accessible, shared, and sustained where people live.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/835099095935492","likes":5,"shares":2,"comments":0,"views":0}

THE STAR OF DAVID DECEPTION The truth is that King David never used a star, so calling it the ‘Star of David‘ is a nice sounding name to cover what it really represents. Satan hides the true meaning of his symbols behind counterfeit explanations. To summarize, the six-pointed star is the supreme symbol of Satanic tyranny, which has been used by people throughout history to directly or indirectly worship Satan. The idolotrous Babylonians, Egyptians and Assyrians used it. The Israelites worshiped star gods, such as Remphan and Chiun. Solomon used it in worship of false gods and to invoke the powers of Satan. The Antichrist Beast of Revelation, the Roman Catholic Church, uses it. The Jesuit-controlled ultra-wealthy Rothchild family uses it to steal the worlds wealth. Satanists, Luciferians, astrologers and witches use it to invoke the power of demons. The six-sided star numerically equals 666 (6 points, 6 triangles, 6-sided hexagon). It’s on Israel’s flag because the Antichrist Jesuits control the state of Israel. Christians shouldn’t have anything to do with the six-pointed star, as it is Satanic. This ‘mark of the beast’ identifies people groups that are Antichrist. The six-sided star was used by Babylonian astrologers for Sun worship. Sigilla Solis 666 Coin Babylonian astrologers divided the starry heavens into 36 constellations (ten days each). These were represented by different amulets called “Sigilla Solis,” or the Sun Seal. These amulets were worn by the pagan priests and they contained all the numbers from 1 to 36. By these figures they claimed to be able to foretell future events. Adding the numbers of any column either horizontally or vertically, and also the two diagonals crossing the square, the total is the same — 111. The sum of the six columns, either horizontally or vertically, is 666. So 666 is a number associated with pagan sun-worship, which originated in the mysteries of ancient pagan Babylon. Sun worship, which is really Satan worship, has existed for thousands of years and is still worshiped to this very day by Mystery Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church and the global elite in the world. The Israelites worshiped the star of foreign gods and were punished for it. Israel adopted the six-pointed star in the wilderness due to their apostasy. The mark of Cain was worshiped by the Israelites in the wilderness as the star of Remphan, which represents the god Saturn, also called Chiun. “But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.“ Amos 5:26 Just before being stoned to death by the Jews, Stephen accused the Jewish leaders, “And you took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the figures which you made” “in order to worship them.” Acts 7:43 Saturn worship is Satan worship. Satan got Solomon to worship him through false gods. After his marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter in 922 B.C., Solomon gave himself up to witchcraft and idolatry, and built altars to Moloch, Ashtoreth and Remphan, the ancient Egyptian ‘Star‘ god. This is very significant, because Solomon was a man of wisdom, who was allowed to build the temple of God; yet late in his life Satan caused him to worship and build altars to false gods, and use the hexagram to invoke the powers of Satan. King Solomon reintroduced the 6-Pointed Star to the Kingdom of Israel, so the Talisman of Saturn became known as the Seal of Solomon. Talisman of Saturn The Six-Pointed Star is engraved on the Talisman of Saturn which is used in ritual magic. A bull’s head is enclosed in a six-pointed star, and surrounded by letters composing the name Rempha, the planetary genius of Saturn, according to the alphabet of the Magi. The bull represents Moloch worship and ultimately, Satan worship. Satanists, Occultist and Freemasons venerate King Solomon, who owned a magic ring that was engraved with the Seal of Solomon, which gave him power over the invisible monarchy of demons. (The History And Practice Of Magic, Vol. 2) The six-pointed star represents Satan, not the Star of David. The Hexagram equates to 666, which Jesus said is the sign of the beast. Sign of the beast is a hexagram, called the star of David It has six points, forms six equilateral triangles, and its interior forms a six-sided hexagon — thus it reveals the number of Satan’s antichrist beast. The 6 points, 6 triangles, and the 6 sides of the hexagon = 666! The Bible attributes the number 666 to Solomon. “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX. ”(Rev. 13:18) “Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX talents of gold...” (1 kings 10:14) So Solomon used the hexagram not David. The Jews in Germany had to wear a star on the outside of their clothes, so that they were easily identified. The hexagram represents Satan worship. Hexagram Satan Goathead Satan ever seeks to establish his worship among the Earth. He even tempted Jesus to bow down and worship him. How much more will he lead people in the end times, either through deceit or enticement, to do the same? Most people aren’t going to worship Satan directly, so he uses other ‘gods’ and ‘idols’, to accept worship indirectly. Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon has been used by Arab Magicians, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches and Satanists. It’s the most powerful symbol used to invoke witchcraft, demons and Satan. Satanism Six-sided star = Hexagram It’s used in magic, witchcraft, sorcery, occultism, alchemy and the casting of zodiacal horoscopes by astrologers. In fact, the word ‘hex‘, as in to put a hex on someone, derives from the word hexagram. According to former Satanist Bill Schnoebelen, who is now a Christian, “a hexagram must be present to call forth a demon” and “it is a very powerful tool to invoke Satan.” It is no mystery that in all the occults, the hex plays a central role in Satan worship and upon and within these covens, human sacrifices are offered to Satan. The hexagram, like the pentagram, is used in practices of the occult and ceremonial magic and is attributed to the 7 “old” planets outlined in astrology. The hexagram represents sun worship, which is Satan worship. Hexagram Solar CalendarThe symbol is linked with sun worship and the sun god which again links back to the Mystery Religions. Deuteronomy 4:19 says “And beware, lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them.” The Satanic Illuminati offers sacrifices to Satan on his revered days, which are based on the cycles of the Sun. 3/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the Spring equinox. 4/19 – A fire sacrifice and a human sacrifice is to be made to the Beast. Note: the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco Branch Davidian siege occurred on this date. 6/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the summer solstice, which is called Litha. 9/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the fall equinox, which is called Mabon. 12/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the winter solstice, which is called Yule. Luciferians revere the hexagram. Luciferians don’t use the name Satan. They believe that Lucifer is the good god, and that the God of the Bible is the evil god. Helena Blavatsky wrote that “Lucifer is the true God“, and she incorporated the hexagram in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, which she founded in 1875. The six-sided star is prominent in their emblem, which includes the Swastika, the Ankh(cross with a circle that represents eternal life), the Aum, and the Ouroboros (an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.). She believed that “There is no religion higher than (Lucifer’s) truth.” “The interlaced triangles, one (lighter) pointing upwards and the other (darker) pointing downwards, symbolise the descent of spirit into matter and its emergence from the confining limits of form. At the same time they suggest the constant conflict between light and dark forces in nature and man. When, as in the emblem, the double triangle is depicted within the circle of the Serpent, the whole of manifested nature is represented, the universe bounded by the limitations of time and space.” Satanists revere the hexagram. Silver Star from Satanist Aleister Crowley Aleister Crowley was a terribly decadent, heroin-addicted, bisexual Satan worshiper, who asked people to call him “The Beast 666.” Crowley believed that he was literally the antimessiah of the apocalypse. He founded the Satanic order of the Silver Star and he designed the unicursal hexagram. His satanic motto was “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Based on those associations, you shouldn’t support anything using the symbol. The Roman Catholic Church, uses the hexagram. As you will see below, the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church reveres the symbol, and every entity that they control uses it too. This includes the Rothchild family, Freemasonry, Zionism, the state of Israel, and false religions. pope-benedict-hexagramHere you can see the Satanic Hexagram prominently placed on the Pope’s mitre. The mitre is shaped like a fish mouth, representing Dagon, the Babylonian fish-god. In the mystery religions, both the forehead and hands were tattooed during rites of initiation, to honor Dagon whose hands and head were cut off by God. Read 1 Samuel 5:1-5 The state of St. Peter at the Vatican features a Satanic hexagram. St. Peter Statue At Vatican With Hexagram. This statue of Peter at the Vatican features the supposed keys to the church and a disguised hexagram. Most people wouldn’t notice the six points, which form the hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church falsely claims that the church was founded by Peter the Apostle. The Satanic hexagram could not represent the true church. And Jesus told us in Revelation that 666 represents the Antichrist beast. . This Pope’s Monstrance features a hexagram surrounded by a Sun symbol. The hexagram is disguised, as most people don’t understand the meaning of the six points on this monstrance. It clearly forms a hexagram, and it has the wafer, the supposed body of Christ, right in the middle of the Satanic symbol. The hexagram is a curse mark, so in essence, this is cursing the body of Christ. Notice that the Sun waves have six-sided stars on them too. St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago features a hexagram. St. Cantius Catholic Church HexagramHere is a hexagram with the Chi-Rho symbol in the middle. It is on the floor of the St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. The Roman Catholic Church Chi-Rho symbol represents the hexagram. Roman Catholic Church Chi Rho Symbol Is 666 HexagramThe Chi-Rho was the Mark of the Roman Empire. It has six points which form a hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church uses the Chi-Rho symbol, as an alternative to the hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Rothchild family uses the Hexagram. The Rothchild family is controlled by the Jesuits, who are the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 17th century, the family changed their last name from Bauer to Rothchild, which means ‘red-shield‘, as family patriarch Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it. Rothchild family crest with Hexagram mark of the beast The red hexagram was patterned after the red Seal of Solomon. The Rothschild’s are Satanists who used this powerful magic symbol in their coat-of-arms. Since 1823, the Rothchilds have controlled the vast financial holdings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Rothchild family is ultra-wealthy because their banking schemes have stolen the wealth of the nations, including the U.S. via the Federal Reserve Bank. They are gathering the world’s wealth, so that they can control the one-world monetary system. They have hundreds of trillions of dollars, and they control the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements in Switzerland, and the central banks of nearly every county in the world. The compass of Freemasonry represents a hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Illuminati infiltrated the order of Freemasonry to use it as a front-organization, to promote their Satanic agenda to create a New World Order. Freemasonry Compass Is A Hexagram You see the hexagram shape hidden in their compass and ruler design, and on their temples. At the lower levels, Freemasons are not made aware of the Satanic secret society. At the 32nd and 33rd degrees of Freemasonry, their god is revealed as Lucifer the light-bearer. The six-pointed “Blazing Star” points to the true deity they worship, Lucifer. Through the Freemasons, the evil elite draw in the best people in society, and promote the ones who conform to their will. This helps them build levels of control, as these people run corporations and governments. King Solomon is the most important figure in Freemasonry, because he fell away from God and worshiped false gods, and he used the six-sided star to invoke the powers of Satan. So how did the Satanic hexagram end up on the state of Israel’s flag? Now that you know that the six-sided star is not really the Star of David, and you know that it is a Satanic symbol, how could it possibly represent a country of people that is referred to as God’s chosen people? The Rothchild’s funded the Zionist movement to create the state of Israel. The state of Israel is controlled by the Jesuits, the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church, through the Rothchild family. In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visited Palestine and subsequently supplied the funds to buy a great deal of property from the Turks and Arabs, to found the first Jewish colonies in Palestine. In 1897, the Rothschild’s founded the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state). The “Rothschild Hexagram” was put on the Zionist flag, which 51 years later ended up on the flag of Israel. The Jesuits engineered WWI and waited until 1917 when Britain was in trouble. They then promised the British Government that they could get the US to enter WWI (on the side of Britain) and thus ensure Britain’s victory of Germany et al. However, they wanted something in return: Palestine. Thus the Balfour Declaration was created, which is an official letter from the British Government Foreign Secretary James Balfour to Baron Rothschild. It states that: ”His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object.” They needed Jews to move to Israel to make it all look legit, so they caused persecution of Jews in Germany during WWII, to get them to move to Palestine. The Jesuits needed the land of Israel to be able to control the Middle East oil reserves, and as you’ve seen, with the help of the U.S., Iraq and Libya’s oil reserves were given to the elite, and an oil pipeline was run through Afghanistan. They also needed to be able to overthrow the leaders of Islamic countries, to replace them with Jesuit-controlled puppets, who will help bring each country into the New World Order. The U.S. has helped remove the leaders in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, etc., and the leaders of Syria and Iran are in the cross-hairs. Ultimately, the Jesuits needed control of the land of Israel to be able to position their end times False Messiah in Jerusalem, which is central to the three major religions. The Satanic Rothchild’s put the hexagram on Israel’s flag instead of a menorah. When the Flag of Israel was unveiled, it was met with tremendous opposition from Jews who realize this Hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions as the symbol of Moloch. The emblem on the flag is a blue colored version of the Rothschild, “Red Hexagram or Sign.” The star is on the flag, because the Rothchild’s own and control the state of Israel. The six-pointed star on Israel’s flag represents Satan, not the Star of David. Today, every major religion uses the Hexagram. Buddhism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Hinduism Shatkona hexagram Buddhism: HexagrOM symbol:- “OM Mani Padme Hum” is the oldest and most important mantra of Tibetan Buddhism, usually translated from Sanskrit as “OM, jewel in the lotus, hum”. The ‘jewel in the lotus‘ may be considered as enlightenment arising in the lotus of human consciousness. This is the holiest of Tibetan mantras, associated with the bodhisattva (“enlightened being”) Avalokiteshvara, and is an expression of compassion as well as a longing for liberation and enlightenment. Hinduism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Buddism hexagram = Shiva + Shakti + Murugan In the Hindu religion, the hexagram is called the Shatkona, and is equivalent to the symbolism in ritual magic. The Shatkona is the combination of the Shiva kona (trikona, triangle), the symbol of the God Shiva, representing the element of fire, and the Shakti kona, representing the element of water. The two components symbolize man’s position between earth and sky. Together, they represent the union of male and female, and the heart chakra. Islam, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram in mosques. Hexagram in a Cube The symbol is known in Arabic as the Najmat Dawud (Star of David) or Khatem Sulayman (Seal of Solomon), It is present in Islam mosques, on the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is geometrically represented in a cube, which Muslims worship in Mecca at the Kabbah Allah black cube. In various places in the Qur’an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, Suliman or Sulayman) were prophets and kings and therefore they are revered figures by Muslims. Mormonism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Mormon Salt Lake City Temple Hexagram The hexagram is also used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. They say it symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. In reality, they are a false religion that was created by the Freemasons, who are controlled by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Church. The hexagram is used by New Agers, who are Antichrist. new-age-hexagram It’s used on their COEXIST bumper stickers, which prepares the world to put away the differences of their religion in the name of peace. Stars like Bono of U2 promote the COEXIST theme, to mislead people. In the New World Order, there will only be one religion, and those who cling to their beliefs in Jesus as the only way to God, will be persecuted. King Solomon’s reign was so peaceful and prosperous that he was thought to be the Messiah. Jews are being led to expect that their Messiah will be a priest-king who is the reincarnation of Solomon. Muslims, Jews, Christians and many other religions, look to Solomon as their forefather. Solomon is primarily revered by the occult societies because he led the nation of Israel away from the worship of the true God into the worship of pagan gods. Christians have been deceived regarding the Satanic power behind the hexagram. The Messianic movement heavily promotes the Star of David. False prophets such as John Hagee use the symbol. This most occult of all symbols is worn as a charm by countless Christians who naively believe that it is a harmless token representing the chosen people of God, and hope that it will bring a kind of blessing on themselves. Those who speak against it are labeled “racist” and “anti-Semitic” due to the world’s misconception that the six-pointed star is Jewish. We must conclude then, that it is an apostate symbol belonging to the occult and totally foreign to Christianity. No true Christian should use it in any manner or fashion, as it is tied to Satan and to the Antichrist beast. The Satanic hexagram is used throughout our cultures. As you go about your life, notice how many times the Hexagram shows up on TV, print, etc. The hexagram shows up in America because the Jesuits control us. Hexagram on the Dollar Bill On the One Dollar bill, a hexagram is formed when the outline of the pyramid and surrounding letters is traced.The Jesuits symbols and words are on the One Dollar bill because they control the Federal Reserve, the I.R.S. and the U.S. Dept. of Treasury. The Star of David Hexagram is on the Great Seal of the Dollar Here it is on the Great Seal of the One Dollar bill. It is above the eagle’s head, formed by 13 stars. The evil elite love the number 13. There’s also 13 leaves, 13 arrows, 13 red/white stripes and 13 tail feathers. Education 2000 Summit features the Star of David Hexagram.

THE STAR OF DAVID DECEPTION The truth is that King David never used a star, so calling it the ‘Star of David‘ is a nice sounding name to cover what it really represents. Satan hides the true meaning of his symbols behind counterfeit explanations. To summarize, the six-pointed star is the supreme symbol of Satanic tyranny, which has been used by people throughout history to directly or indirectly worship Satan. The idolotrous Babylonians, Egyptians and Assyrians used it. The Israelites worshiped star gods, such as Remphan and Chiun. Solomon used it in worship of false gods and to invoke the powers of Satan. The Antichrist Beast of Revelation, the Roman Catholic Church, uses it. The Jesuit-controlled ultra-wealthy Rothchild family uses it to steal the worlds wealth. Satanists, Luciferians, astrologers and witches use it to invoke the power of demons. The six-sided star numerically equals 666 (6 points, 6 triangles, 6-sided hexagon). It’s on Israel’s flag because the Antichrist Jesuits control the state of Israel. Christians shouldn’t have anything to do with the six-pointed star, as it is Satanic. This ‘mark of the beast’ identifies people groups that are Antichrist. The six-sided star was used by Babylonian astrologers for Sun worship. Sigilla Solis 666 Coin Babylonian astrologers divided the starry heavens into 36 constellations (ten days each). These were represented by different amulets called “Sigilla Solis,” or the Sun Seal. These amulets were worn by the pagan priests and they contained all the numbers from 1 to 36. By these figures they claimed to be able to foretell future events. Adding the numbers of any column either horizontally or vertically, and also the two diagonals crossing the square, the total is the same — 111. The sum of the six columns, either horizontally or vertically, is 666. So 666 is a number associated with pagan sun-worship, which originated in the mysteries of ancient pagan Babylon. Sun worship, which is really Satan worship, has existed for thousands of years and is still worshiped to this very day by Mystery Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church and the global elite in the world. The Israelites worshiped the star of foreign gods and were punished for it. Israel adopted the six-pointed star in the wilderness due to their apostasy. The mark of Cain was worshiped by the Israelites in the wilderness as the star of Remphan, which represents the god Saturn, also called Chiun. “But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.“ Amos 5:26 Just before being stoned to death by the Jews, Stephen accused the Jewish leaders, “And you took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the figures which you made” “in order to worship them.” Acts 7:43 Saturn worship is Satan worship. Satan got Solomon to worship him through false gods. After his marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter in 922 B.C., Solomon gave himself up to witchcraft and idolatry, and built altars to Moloch, Ashtoreth and Remphan, the ancient Egyptian ‘Star‘ god. This is very significant, because Solomon was a man of wisdom, who was allowed to build the temple of God; yet late in his life Satan caused him to worship and build altars to false gods, and use the hexagram to invoke the powers of Satan. King Solomon reintroduced the 6-Pointed Star to the Kingdom of Israel, so the Talisman of Saturn became known as the Seal of Solomon. Talisman of Saturn The Six-Pointed Star is engraved on the Talisman of Saturn which is used in ritual magic. A bull’s head is enclosed in a six-pointed star, and surrounded by letters composing the name Rempha, the planetary genius of Saturn, according to the alphabet of the Magi. The bull represents Moloch worship and ultimately, Satan worship. Satanists, Occultist and Freemasons venerate King Solomon, who owned a magic ring that was engraved with the Seal of Solomon, which gave him power over the invisible monarchy of demons. (The History And Practice Of Magic, Vol. 2) The six-pointed star represents Satan, not the Star of David. The Hexagram equates to 666, which Jesus said is the sign of the beast. Sign of the beast is a hexagram, called the star of David It has six points, forms six equilateral triangles, and its interior forms a six-sided hexagon — thus it reveals the number of Satan’s antichrist beast. The 6 points, 6 triangles, and the 6 sides of the hexagon = 666! The Bible attributes the number 666 to Solomon. “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX. ”(Rev. 13:18) “Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX talents of gold...” (1 kings 10:14) So Solomon used the hexagram not David. The Jews in Germany had to wear a star on the outside of their clothes, so that they were easily identified. The hexagram represents Satan worship. Hexagram Satan Goathead Satan ever seeks to establish his worship among the Earth. He even tempted Jesus to bow down and worship him. How much more will he lead people in the end times, either through deceit or enticement, to do the same? Most people aren’t going to worship Satan directly, so he uses other ‘gods’ and ‘idols’, to accept worship indirectly. Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon has been used by Arab Magicians, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches and Satanists. It’s the most powerful symbol used to invoke witchcraft, demons and Satan. Satanism Six-sided star = Hexagram It’s used in magic, witchcraft, sorcery, occultism, alchemy and the casting of zodiacal horoscopes by astrologers. In fact, the word ‘hex‘, as in to put a hex on someone, derives from the word hexagram. According to former Satanist Bill Schnoebelen, who is now a Christian, “a hexagram must be present to call forth a demon” and “it is a very powerful tool to invoke Satan.” It is no mystery that in all the occults, the hex plays a central role in Satan worship and upon and within these covens, human sacrifices are offered to Satan. The hexagram, like the pentagram, is used in practices of the occult and ceremonial magic and is attributed to the 7 “old” planets outlined in astrology. The hexagram represents sun worship, which is Satan worship. Hexagram Solar CalendarThe symbol is linked with sun worship and the sun god which again links back to the Mystery Religions. Deuteronomy 4:19 says “And beware, lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them.” The Satanic Illuminati offers sacrifices to Satan on his revered days, which are based on the cycles of the Sun. 3/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the Spring equinox. 4/19 – A fire sacrifice and a human sacrifice is to be made to the Beast. Note: the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco Branch Davidian siege occurred on this date. 6/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the summer solstice, which is called Litha. 9/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the fall equinox, which is called Mabon. 12/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the winter solstice, which is called Yule. Luciferians revere the hexagram. Luciferians don’t use the name Satan. They believe that Lucifer is the good god, and that the God of the Bible is the evil god. Helena Blavatsky wrote that “Lucifer is the true God“, and she incorporated the hexagram in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, which she founded in 1875. The six-sided star is prominent in their emblem, which includes the Swastika, the Ankh(cross with a circle that represents eternal life), the Aum, and the Ouroboros (an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.). She believed that “There is no religion higher than (Lucifer’s) truth.” “The interlaced triangles, one (lighter) pointing upwards and the other (darker) pointing downwards, symbolise the descent of spirit into matter and its emergence from the confining limits of form. At the same time they suggest the constant conflict between light and dark forces in nature and man. When, as in the emblem, the double triangle is depicted within the circle of the Serpent, the whole of manifested nature is represented, the universe bounded by the limitations of time and space.” Satanists revere the hexagram. Silver Star from Satanist Aleister Crowley Aleister Crowley was a terribly decadent, heroin-addicted, bisexual Satan worshiper, who asked people to call him “The Beast 666.” Crowley believed that he was literally the antimessiah of the apocalypse. He founded the Satanic order of the Silver Star and he designed the unicursal hexagram. His satanic motto was “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Based on those associations, you shouldn’t support anything using the symbol. The Roman Catholic Church, uses the hexagram. As you will see below, the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church reveres the symbol, and every entity that they control uses it too. This includes the Rothchild family, Freemasonry, Zionism, the state of Israel, and false religions. pope-benedict-hexagramHere you can see the Satanic Hexagram prominently placed on the Pope’s mitre. The mitre is shaped like a fish mouth, representing Dagon, the Babylonian fish-god. In the mystery religions, both the forehead and hands were tattooed during rites of initiation, to honor Dagon whose hands and head were cut off by God. Read 1 Samuel 5:1-5 The state of St. Peter at the Vatican features a Satanic hexagram. St. Peter Statue At Vatican With Hexagram. This statue of Peter at the Vatican features the supposed keys to the church and a disguised hexagram. Most people wouldn’t notice the six points, which form the hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church falsely claims that the church was founded by Peter the Apostle. The Satanic hexagram could not represent the true church. And Jesus told us in Revelation that 666 represents the Antichrist beast. . This Pope’s Monstrance features a hexagram surrounded by a Sun symbol. The hexagram is disguised, as most people don’t understand the meaning of the six points on this monstrance. It clearly forms a hexagram, and it has the wafer, the supposed body of Christ, right in the middle of the Satanic symbol. The hexagram is a curse mark, so in essence, this is cursing the body of Christ. Notice that the Sun waves have six-sided stars on them too. St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago features a hexagram. St. Cantius Catholic Church HexagramHere is a hexagram with the Chi-Rho symbol in the middle. It is on the floor of the St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. The Roman Catholic Church Chi-Rho symbol represents the hexagram. Roman Catholic Church Chi Rho Symbol Is 666 HexagramThe Chi-Rho was the Mark of the Roman Empire. It has six points which form a hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church uses the Chi-Rho symbol, as an alternative to the hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Rothchild family uses the Hexagram. The Rothchild family is controlled by the Jesuits, who are the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 17th century, the family changed their last name from Bauer to Rothchild, which means ‘red-shield‘, as family patriarch Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it. Rothchild family crest with Hexagram mark of the beast The red hexagram was patterned after the red Seal of Solomon. The Rothschild’s are Satanists who used this powerful magic symbol in their coat-of-arms. Since 1823, the Rothchilds have controlled the vast financial holdings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Rothchild family is ultra-wealthy because their banking schemes have stolen the wealth of the nations, including the U.S. via the Federal Reserve Bank. They are gathering the world’s wealth, so that they can control the one-world monetary system. They have hundreds of trillions of dollars, and they control the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements in Switzerland, and the central banks of nearly every county in the world. The compass of Freemasonry represents a hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Illuminati infiltrated the order of Freemasonry to use it as a front-organization, to promote their Satanic agenda to create a New World Order. Freemasonry Compass Is A Hexagram You see the hexagram shape hidden in their compass and ruler design, and on their temples. At the lower levels, Freemasons are not made aware of the Satanic secret society. At the 32nd and 33rd degrees of Freemasonry, their god is revealed as Lucifer the light-bearer. The six-pointed “Blazing Star” points to the true deity they worship, Lucifer. Through the Freemasons, the evil elite draw in the best people in society, and promote the ones who conform to their will. This helps them build levels of control, as these people run corporations and governments. King Solomon is the most important figure in Freemasonry, because he fell away from God and worshiped false gods, and he used the six-sided star to invoke the powers of Satan. So how did the Satanic hexagram end up on the state of Israel’s flag? Now that you know that the six-sided star is not really the Star of David, and you know that it is a Satanic symbol, how could it possibly represent a country of people that is referred to as God’s chosen people? The Rothchild’s funded the Zionist movement to create the state of Israel. The state of Israel is controlled by the Jesuits, the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church, through the Rothchild family. In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visited Palestine and subsequently supplied the funds to buy a great deal of property from the Turks and Arabs, to found the first Jewish colonies in Palestine. In 1897, the Rothschild’s founded the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state). The “Rothschild Hexagram” was put on the Zionist flag, which 51 years later ended up on the flag of Israel. The Jesuits engineered WWI and waited until 1917 when Britain was in trouble. They then promised the British Government that they could get the US to enter WWI (on the side of Britain) and thus ensure Britain’s victory of Germany et al. However, they wanted something in return: Palestine. Thus the Balfour Declaration was created, which is an official letter from the British Government Foreign Secretary James Balfour to Baron Rothschild. It states that: ”His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object.” They needed Jews to move to Israel to make it all look legit, so they caused persecution of Jews in Germany during WWII, to get them to move to Palestine. The Jesuits needed the land of Israel to be able to control the Middle East oil reserves, and as you’ve seen, with the help of the U.S., Iraq and Libya’s oil reserves were given to the elite, and an oil pipeline was run through Afghanistan. They also needed to be able to overthrow the leaders of Islamic countries, to replace them with Jesuit-controlled puppets, who will help bring each country into the New World Order. The U.S. has helped remove the leaders in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, etc., and the leaders of Syria and Iran are in the cross-hairs. Ultimately, the Jesuits needed control of the land of Israel to be able to position their end times False Messiah in Jerusalem, which is central to the three major religions. The Satanic Rothchild’s put the hexagram on Israel’s flag instead of a menorah. When the Flag of Israel was unveiled, it was met with tremendous opposition from Jews who realize this Hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions as the symbol of Moloch. The emblem on the flag is a blue colored version of the Rothschild, “Red Hexagram or Sign.” The star is on the flag, because the Rothchild’s own and control the state of Israel. The six-pointed star on Israel’s flag represents Satan, not the Star of David. Today, every major religion uses the Hexagram. Buddhism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Hinduism Shatkona hexagram Buddhism: HexagrOM symbol:- “OM Mani Padme Hum” is the oldest and most important mantra of Tibetan Buddhism, usually translated from Sanskrit as “OM, jewel in the lotus, hum”. The ‘jewel in the lotus‘ may be considered as enlightenment arising in the lotus of human consciousness. This is the holiest of Tibetan mantras, associated with the bodhisattva (“enlightened being”) Avalokiteshvara, and is an expression of compassion as well as a longing for liberation and enlightenment. Hinduism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Buddism hexagram = Shiva + Shakti + Murugan In the Hindu religion, the hexagram is called the Shatkona, and is equivalent to the symbolism in ritual magic. The Shatkona is the combination of the Shiva kona (trikona, triangle), the symbol of the God Shiva, representing the element of fire, and the Shakti kona, representing the element of water. The two components symbolize man’s position between earth and sky. Together, they represent the union of male and female, and the heart chakra. Islam, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram in mosques. Hexagram in a Cube The symbol is known in Arabic as the Najmat Dawud (Star of David) or Khatem Sulayman (Seal of Solomon), It is present in Islam mosques, on the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is geometrically represented in a cube, which Muslims worship in Mecca at the Kabbah Allah black cube. In various places in the Qur’an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, Suliman or Sulayman) were prophets and kings and therefore they are revered figures by Muslims. Mormonism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Mormon Salt Lake City Temple Hexagram The hexagram is also used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. They say it symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. In reality, they are a false religion that was created by the Freemasons, who are controlled by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Church. The hexagram is used by New Agers, who are Antichrist. new-age-hexagram It’s used on their COEXIST bumper stickers, which prepares the world to put away the differences of their religion in the name of peace. Stars like Bono of U2 promote the COEXIST theme, to mislead people. In the New World Order, there will only be one religion, and those who cling to their beliefs in Jesus as the only way to God, will be persecuted. King Solomon’s reign was so peaceful and prosperous that he was thought to be the Messiah. Jews are being led to expect that their Messiah will be a priest-king who is the reincarnation of Solomon. Muslims, Jews, Christians and many other religions, look to Solomon as their forefather. Solomon is primarily revered by the occult societies because he led the nation of Israel away from the worship of the true God into the worship of pagan gods. Christians have been deceived regarding the Satanic power behind the hexagram. The Messianic movement heavily promotes the Star of David. False prophets such as John Hagee use the symbol. This most occult of all symbols is worn as a charm by countless Christians who naively believe that it is a harmless token representing the chosen people of God, and hope that it will bring a kind of blessing on themselves. Those who speak against it are labeled “racist” and “anti-Semitic” due to the world’s misconception that the six-pointed star is Jewish. We must conclude then, that it is an apostate symbol belonging to the occult and totally foreign to Christianity. No true Christian should use it in any manner or fashion, as it is tied to Satan and to the Antichrist beast. The Satanic hexagram is used throughout our cultures. As you go about your life, notice how many times the Hexagram shows up on TV, print, etc. The hexagram shows up in America because the Jesuits control us. Hexagram on the Dollar Bill On the One Dollar bill, a hexagram is formed when the outline of the pyramid and surrounding letters is traced.The Jesuits symbols and words are on the One Dollar bill because they control the Federal Reserve, the I.R.S. and the U.S. Dept. of Treasury. The Star of David Hexagram is on the Great Seal of the Dollar Here it is on the Great Seal of the One Dollar bill. It is above the eagle’s head, formed by 13 stars. The evil elite love the number 13. There’s also 13 leaves, 13 arrows, 13 red/white stripes and 13 tail feathers. Education 2000 Summit features the Star of David Hexagram.

Even if you need it and your 5 days early for a refill which they knew they didn't give me the full amount previously. Had 2 doctor's visits today and had to fight and argue and sell my stuff to buy the medicine I need to stay alive. The Healthcare industry can be the absolute worst. On top of that I met my social worker and she hates me, she says that they are going to deny my foodstamps because you have to work at least 20 hours a week and i cant work. But she gave me a box with stuff that's expired and I wolnt eat. So at least there's that. Im trying so hard. Without Marti I am lost, I feel like she was keeping me alive. I'll always remember her, all the good parts, our roadtrips, our adventures with our dogs, the movies I blackmarketed we watched. Sharing the smallest shower lol. All the moped rides we went on or motorcycle rides when she put her arms around me and leaned on my back. I miss her, she always helped me get through times like this. Sorry im just mad that to save my life i had to have a miracle happen and someone paid for some of my medications for me. If not id probably die in 2-3 days. You guys have no idea how thankful for each dollar im gifted. Im not giving up, not giving in. I will walk without a limp when I heal. Love all you guys! I am so thankful for the person who literally saved my life when I couldn't afford it. There are some good people out there.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10164652735938352","likes":0,"shares":0,"comments":2,"views":0,"text_altered":"Just in case you wanted to know if you want to buy eliquis without insurance its close to 2k for a 30 day prescription.

NO CHEMO! Now my choice is Alternative Treatment to include: Ivermetin/Fenben high dose kill protocol, Berberine, Curcumin, a binder, Quercetin, Avacado (for absorption)Melatonin, 17hr daily intermittent fasting, daily gym workout. I'd LOVE to hear some positive messages to cheer me up a bit - my journey so far has been full of steadfast not-give-up and upbeat spirit but not gonna lie - this result is a bummer. I'm NOT giving up or giving in but need to both plan and hope. Therefore, I've decided to take a huge road trip in Spring, “The Gratitude Lap – Final Round.\" Anyone outside Maine that would like to participate in this grand event (to include putting me up a night or two) give me a shout.

Come now - it's the Boks' green hydra gargling French tears in Turin, facing down an Azzurri no longer under the radar. We've got the scalps, the depth dialed deep, and the skulls geared to jam into the cogs. No sidestepping blood if glory's the game. No, you don't need me to spell it; you know it bone-deep like a Bok tackle - what your skeleton feels like inside your flesh - that innate certainty perfumed with the thrill of the unfolding. To some, it'll always look like arrogance. But is it not the simple math of momentum meeting the momentary, the inevitable echo from events? If I'm going on tangent, it's because Italy believes this is their shot - the outsiders' dream. And they're right. It's a dream. Everyone will want to put their hand up today, stain the jersey with their blood. Repeat lineups are recipes for rust, sayeth Rassie. Complacency embarrassed us earlier this year against Australia at Ellis Park, but truth be told, the cracks were hairline against Italy - despite nulling them with 14 men last. We're making amends well when required this year, and with grievances, the minds of the fresh charges look well framed. Add to this a bench that chews souls, and Italy's dream sours quick. We won't be taking them easy, but take them we will, one way or another. The wordless wink this week: Do we really need adversity to thrive? Against Italy no less... It's a mythological trap that could one day undo us. Personnel's not the main puzzle - the mind's contingencies win this war. Do we need the brink to bite? Boss from boot to buzzer, no flirt with the fall? Warp-spasm our weird wingman, or bad Bok habit? Must we dip to better soar? Pondering that's pure luxury. That's how far we've come.

On October 17th late Friday my right leg including my foot swelled dramatically. I wasn’t’ sure what it was & hoped it would pass, and it didn’t so Monday I called 911 and was rushed to ER at Lutheran General Hospital where I was diagnosed with a major +DVT (Deep Venous Thrombosis) which in lay terms is a blood clot. I was immediately put on blood thinners (LMW-Heparin ie. Lovenox). Ultra sound & CT scans revealed a clot starting below my knee in my calf, leading up my thigh all the way into my inferior vena cava, along with a few pulmonary embolisms (thankfully non-life threatening due to their placement). Surgery was scheduled first for Wednesday the 22nd but finally happened Thursday the 23rd. I basically had a human RotoRouter performed where one orthoscopic went in behind my right knee & a second came in from up high in the top of my neck. Both would meet in the middle and the surgeon said the clot they pulled out was over 3 ft long. Also the neck probe went over to my left leg to remove some residual clotting I had there as well.. (I had been plagued with some edema in my feet off and on, for quite a while, thinking it was water retention not knowing it was actually clots).

WESTERN SOCIETY IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME...⏳️ How many of us are disturbed and concerned about this recent influx of immigrants throughout the western nations? Do we know why these open borders are taking place? I've done some digging, and have come to a conclusion why we are being bombarded with these trouble making, & nation destroying 'Doctors & Engineers'. Before I present my research, I want to make it amply clear that I personally find the takeover by certain immigrants totally and utterly abhorrent, & very few in their right mind would disagree with me. Let me further state, that these troublemakers are being used by higher powers to bring Europe, the U.S.A, and Australia to their knees. Little does anyone realise that these minion migrants are mere chess pieces being controlled & moved across the chessboard by their enemy, and by our enemy, the Jews in power. Hear me out... It's extremely clear that there's a move taking place to destroy the western civilisation. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, taking over a nation or country is no longer fought on the battle ground! All it takes is opening your borders, and the battle is won. Any deaths? Yes, patriotism, peace, hope, protection, and dreams die a long, slow, miserable death. I used to be so anti Palestine, well...I still am, but after a lot of research, I'm going to add the powerhouse Jews to the same list of enemies of our people and the ones to watch. Before I get into the crux of my post, let me remind everyone- Who owns the banks? Jews. Who owns Hollywood? Jews Who owns the media? Jews Pfizer CEO? A Jew Who owns Facebook? A Jew Who owns Google? A Jew If one desires to rule the world, place them in positions of power. He who has the gold, calls the tune. Now for my message... Richard Coudenhove Kalergi who is the father of the European Union, and who was funded by the Jewish bankers Rothschild and Faubourg Warburg. In 1925, Richard wrote a book called 'Praktischer Idealismus', translated to 'Practical Ideals'. In it, he stated that the Jews are a master race, and that the Jews can only assume the throne, and to rule over the world by WEAKENING THE EUROPEAN RACE. To do so, he stated, would be to dissolve all the European nations, destroy all their cultural heritage, and their national traditions, and replace them with the European Union, and then to INVITE IN AFRICANS, ASIANS, AND MIDDLE EASTERN EUROPEANS to dilute the blood of Europe through *Miscegenation to the point that they become a degenerate mixed race. And then at that point, the people would no longer have any sense of nationhood. * Miscegenation meaning- 'Sexual relations or reproduction between people of different ethnic groups, especially when one of them is white'. The Jews can then rule the world, and this was completely in-line with what Nikolai had written in 1917 and it has come to fruition when seeing the blatant intrusion of the immigrants from said nations into Europe, America, and Australia! 'They' are deliberately setting up to genocide the white race and destroy all sense of patriotism, nationhood, national heritage, and national culture in the western societies. Nothing is coincidence! These open borders are planned and implemented for a reason. The bleeding hearts of the loony lefties are being brainwashed and used by those who they despise. How clever are those who are able to control their enemies to carry out their own sinister plans. Those who attend the Pro-Palestine protests are our enemies. They are aiding in destroying our once safe and protected western civilisations. All governing bodies who allow open borders are treasonous. This is going to put the cat amongst the pigeons. Hitler became the enemy of those who wanted to destroy the western world! Hitler has become a dirty word, but one day, we are all going to understand who the real enemy was. Hitler's name became dirt in every WW2 Hollywood movie. Films, whilst thoroughly entertaining, are propaganda mediums to colour our thinking to suit a particular narrative. Nobody really understands history until they've lived it. Enough said....","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/2665677700452864","likes":50,"shares":9,"comments":227,"views":0}

I want to share something personal and hopefully help bring awareness to others who might be struggling without answers. During my many different chemo treatments, I also had Keytruda treatments, an immunotherapy drug that helps the immune system attack cancer cells. It saves lives — including mine — but at the same time it almost cost me my life. In my case, Keytruda ramped my immune system up so much that it attacked my organs, causing something called adrenal insufficiency (AI) — a condition where my adrenal glands no longer make enough cortisol, the hormone that helps control stress, blood pressure, and energy levels, body temperatures, electrolytes, and more. Now, every single day, I rely on steroid replacement medication just to stay alive. My body can’t produce its own cortisol, which means even a small illness, high stress, dehydration, or missed dose could become dangerous. It’s not something you can “just push through.” Adrenal insufficiency is rare among people who’ve had immunotherapy (i think they said less than 1% chance of this happening) — but it’s underdiagnosed and often misunderstood. Here’s what I wish more people knew: 💡 Adrenal insufficiency is life-threatening if untreated. 💡 It’s not fatigue or laziness— it’s a complete lack of cortisol. My body is crashing. 💡 People living with AI must carry emergency medication at all times. 💡 Stress, illness, or injury can trigger an adrenal crisis — a medical emergency. I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but for awareness. If you know someone who’s been on immunotherapy and is constantly exhausted, dizzy, or fainting — encourage them to ask their doctor to check their cortisol levels. It could save their life. I’m still standing, still fighting, and still grateful for every day. 💪 If my story helps even one person get diagnosed or treated sooner, then it’s worth sharing. #AdrenalInsufficiencyAwareness #CancerJourney #Keytruda #AutoimmuneSideEffects #KeepFighting","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10236774873206653","likes":8,"shares":2,"comments":108,"views":0}

Something beautiful about choosing kindness even when there is no audience 👥, no cameras 📷, no applause 👏. It’s in those silent moments — those unseen seconds — where your TRUE character shows 🌟💛. 🌙✨ When you choose patience over anger 😤➡️😌, love over ego 💔➡️❤️, and truth over convenience 🚫➡️✔️… even when no one knows about it… that’s when you grow. That’s when your soul becomes stronger 💪, softer 💖, kinder 🌿, wiser 🧠, and more grounded 🌍. 📖💫 Your story is not written by who praises you… but by how you treat people behind closed doors, how you behave when your name isn’t being called, and how you act when there’s nothing to gain 🌈. 🕊️✨ Being good in private is a form of integrity that can’t be faked. It doesn’t need an audience. It doesn’t need validation. It doesn’t need attention. It simply grows from the heart 💗 — from a place of sincerity, g Somewhere along the way, I stopped needing everyone to understand me. I stopped over-explaining my silence, my choices, my healing, and my boundaries. Growth taught me that peace doesn't come from being heard by the world — it comes from finally listening to yourself. I’ve faced storms I never saw coming and walked through seasons I never thought I’d survive. I’ve smiled with a heavy heart, showed up with shaking hands, and kept going when my soul was tired. That’s strength — the kind that no one claps for, but that changes everything. I’ve lost people, moments, and parts of myself I thought I’d never get back. But in that loss, I found clarity. I found self-resp. I found God in the silence, and power in becoming someone new. So no, I’m not the same. I don’t react the same. I don’t chase the same. I’m learning to protect my space, to pour into what pours back, and to love without losing m Healing isn’t pretty. It’s not always soft. Sometimes it looks like pulling away, crying in silence, or outgrowing people you love. But I’ve made peace with that. Because every time I chose myself, even when it was hard, I became more whole. I don’t have all the answers. I still have scars. But I’m proud of the person I’m becoming — someone who values peace over attention, depth over surface, and alignment over approval. This chapter is no longer about proving my worth. It’s about living in it. So if you’re in a quiet season, one where everything feels uncertain — don’t give up. Sometimes, the most powerful transformations happen when no one is watching. I no longer chase what doesn’t choose me. I no longer explain what peace feels like to people committed to chaos. My silence is no longer discomfort — it’s my healing. It’s my clarity. It’s my protection. I’ve outgrown the version of me that begged for love, settled for less, and called it loyalty. I now understand that not everyone is meant to go with me — and that letting go doesn’t mean I stopped caring. It means I started caring for *me*. I’m learning to be okay with being misunderstood. With being distant. With being selective. Because not everyone deserves access to the version of me I worked so hard to rebuild. I walk differently now — not because I think I’m better, but because I know I’m worth more. And I’ve earned the right to protect my energy, set my standards, and speak only when it matters. This isn’t just a new season — it’s a new standard. And from here on out, anything that costs me my peace is too expensive. I’ve realized that becoming isn’t loud. It doesn’t always look like success, trophies, or applause. Sometimes it’s just choosing not to react. Choosing rest instead of burnout. Choosing solitude over fake support. And that’s growth too. The kind no one sees — but *you* feel. So now, I move with intention. Not to prove anything, not to chase anything — but to protect the peace I fought so hard to find. No more begging to be seen. No more shrinking to be liked. No more explaining to be understood. I’m not becoming who the world expects. I’m becoming who I *need*. And that, for me, is enough. This is the season where I water myself. Where I trust the slow days, the silent shifts, and the sacred space in between. Because real growth? It doesn’t always shout. Sometimes… it just *blooms quietly*. I no longer rush healing. I no longer rush life. Everything meant for me will arrive in peace, not pressure. So I’m learning to breathe. To be fully present. To find beauty in the now — even if it’s messy, quiet, or unfamiliar. Some days, I still feel lost. Some days, I overthink. But even on those days, I’m proud — Because I no longer abandon myself just to feel accepted. I show up for me now. Gently. With grace. With patience. With truth. And if you’re on this journey too — You’re not late. You’re not behind. You’re not broken. You’re becoming. And that’s the most courageous thing of all. So keep softening without losing your strength. Keep glowing, even if no one notices yet. Keep walking — even when your voice shakes. Because your becoming is valid. And your peace is sacred. I’ve come to accept that not everything will make sense right away. Some chapters only reveal their purpose after the pain. Some people were lessons, not lifetimes. And some endings were really just beginnings in disguise. But through it all — I kept rising. Not because it was easy, but because something in me refused to give up. I owe that version of me… the one who held on silently… everything. So from now on, I celebrate the quiet wins. The boundaries kept. The healing I chose. The peace I protected. The love I gave myself when no one else knew I needed it. Because true strength isn’t loud. It’s soft. It’s sacred. It’s steady. I’m not chasing the spotlight anymore. I’m chasing alignment. I’m chasing purpose. I’m chasing peace. And in doing that — I’ve finally found *me*.#fblifestyle I mean always Always put yourself first ✨💛… because your heart, your peace, and your dreams deserve priority 💗🌙. Too many times you’ve carried people, situations, and problems that were never yours to hold 😔🧳. Now it’s time to carry yourself — with love, with care, with strength, and with pride 💪🏽❤️👑.

I don’t think it's any ones business who I date. Plus I need some privacy to protect the wellbeing of our relationship. Secondly , yes the rumours are true , we sent out wedding invitations to Family and Close friends last week . We're getting married on 28 December 2025. I'm very happy about it and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with the one that I love 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤ ! Lastly , I stole this post from a friend because I knew you'd read it.

{"post_id":"122301840248207946","created_at":"2025-11-22T14:31:08","platform":"facebook","author_id":"61556238400470","text":"Healthcare is broken Healthcare in costs in America is a tragedy 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 A U.S. government study found that in 2022, U.S. drug prices were on average ~229 % of Canadian prices (i.e., Canadian prices were about 44 % of what Americans paid) for the same drugs. Another review noted that for brand-name drugs, U.S. prices can be ~3 to 4 times higher than in Canada (or higher, depending on the specific drug). For example: Eliquis (a blood thinner) costs in the U.S. ~$1,668 for 180 tablets, while in Canada the lowest listed price was ~$370. Jardiance (for diabetes) cost ~$1,845 in the U.S. for 90 tablets versus ~$290 in Canada. An analysis found that Rinvoq (for Crohn’s/ulcerative colitis) is ~$11,915 in the U.S. vs ~$1,749.95 in Canada — roughly 7× the Canadian price. ⚠️ Examples of drugs with large U.S.–Canada price gaps Eliquis: ~4.5× higher in the U.S. vs Canada. Jardiance: ~6×+ higher in the U.S. vs Canada. Rinvoq: ~7× higher. In a broader list: Latuda (an antipsychotic) 90 tablets cost ~$4,628 in U.S., ~$520 in Canada (~89 % cheaper in Canada). Synthroid (for hypothyroidism) cost ~$114 in U.S. vs ~$44 in Canada (≈ 160 % higher in U.S.) in one older study. 🧠 Why does this happen? Canada uses government regulation and negotiation to constrain prices for patented drugs; the U.S. historically has fewer nationwide restrictions on drug manufacturer pricing. Brand-name drugs (patented) show the largest price gaps; generics often have smaller or even reversed differences. A study found that in 2017 the U.S. spent US $2,497 per person on health-care administrative costs, compared with US $551 per person in Canada. That’s more than 4× the Canadian per-capita amount. The source pointed out that if the U.S. reduced administrative costs to Canadian levels, it could potentially save over US $600 billion annually. Interpretation: A large chunk of U.S. spending is not directly care for patients, but overhead, billing, management, insurer profits, etc. 🔍 Example 2: Overall Spending and Payments to Providers The U.S. spends roughly twice as much per person as “peer” countries (including Canada) when it comes to health care. Much of the difference comes from higher payments to hospitals, physicians, and higher prices for services — not necessarily more services. For example: A source reports that the U.S. was spending ~16.8% of GDP on healthcare vs Canada’s ~10.8% (in one comparison) with the U.S. per-person cost at ~US $10,948 vs Canada ~US $5,370. 🔍 Example 3: Drug Pricing & Provider Mark-Ups While this example is more indirect, a recent report by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that U.S. pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) marked up prices of specialty generic drugs by thousands of percent between 2017-2022, leading to multi-billion-dollar gains. Higher negotiated prices, mark-ups, and less regulation in the U.S. contribute to higher profits in the supply chain. 🔍 Why This Shows Higher Profits (and Costs) If administrative/overhead costs are dramatically higher in the U.S., that means a larger portion of healthcare dollars is going to management, insurers, bureaucratic functions, profit margins — rather than directly to clinical care. Higher per-person payments to hospitals and physicians suggest that U.S. providers can charge (and are paid) more for the same or similar services. Higher drug mark-ups and profit-oriented structures in the U.S. supply chain mean more of the spending ends up as profit (or margin) rather than being passed on in lower consumer/patient cost. When you combine these factors, you end up with a system where expenditures are high, yet outcomes (on many measures) are not better (and in some cases worse) compared to Canada. For instance, Canada often achieves similar or better outcomes at lower cost. ✅ Summary Yes — there is strong evidence that the U.S. healthcare system enables higher profits and overheads (for insurers, administrators, providers) compared to Canada, which contributes to the much higher cost burden on U.S. patients and payers.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/122301840248207946","likes":10,"shares":5,"comments":2,"views":100}

Satan hides the true meaning of his symbols behind counterfeit explanations. To summarize, the six-pointed star is the supreme symbol of Satanic tyranny, which has been used by people throughout history to directly or indirectly worship Satan. The idolotrous Babylonians, Egyptians and Assyrians used it. The Israelites worshiped star gods, such as Remphan and Chiun. Solomon used it in worship of false gods and to invoke the powers of Satan. The Antichrist Beast of Revelation, the Roman Catholic Church, uses it. The Jesuit-controlled ultra-wealthy Rothchild family uses it to steal the worlds wealth. Satanists, Luciferians, astrologers and witches use it to invoke the power of demons. The six-sided star numerically equals 666 (6 points, 6 triangles, 6-sided hexagon). It’s on Israel’s flag because the Antichrist Jesuits control the state of Israel. Christians shouldn’t have anything to do with the six-pointed star, as it is Satanic. This ‘mark of the beast’ identifies people groups that are Antichrist. The six-sided star was used by Babylonian astrologers for Sun worship. Sigilla Solis 666 Coin Babylonian astrologers divided the starry heavens into 36 constellations (ten days each). These were represented by different amulets called “Sigilla Solis,” or the Sun Seal. These amulets were worn by the pagan priests and they contained all the numbers from 1 to 36. By these figures they claimed to be able to foretell future events. Adding the numbers of any column either horizontally or vertically, and also the two diagonals crossing the square, the total is the same — 111. The sum of the six columns, either horizontally or vertically, is 666. So 666 is a number associated with pagan sun-worship, which originated in the mysteries of ancient pagan Babylon. Sun worship, which is really Satan worship, has existed for thousands of years and is still worshiped to this very day by Mystery Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church and the global elite in the world. The Israelites worshiped the star of foreign gods and were punished for it. Israel adopted the six-pointed star in the wilderness due to their apostasy. The mark of Cain was worshiped by the Israelites in the wilderness as the star of Remphan, which represents the god Saturn, also called Chiun. “But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.“ Amos 5:26 Just before being stoned to death by the Jews, Stephen accused the Jewish leaders, “And you took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the figures which you made” “in order to worship them.” Acts 7:43 Saturn worship is Satan worship. Satan got Solomon to worship him through false gods. After his marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter in 922 B.C., Solomon gave himself up to witchcraft and idolatry, and built altars to Moloch, Ashtoreth and Remphan, the ancient Egyptian ‘Star‘ god. This is very significant, because Solomon was a man of wisdom, who was allowed to build the temple of God; yet late in his life Satan caused him to worship and build altars to false gods, and use the hexagram to invoke the powers of Satan. King Solomon reintroduced the 6-Pointed Star to the Kingdom of Israel, so the Talisman of Saturn became known as the Seal of Solomon. Talisman of Saturn The Six-Pointed Star is engraved on the Talisman of Saturn which is used in ritual magic. A bull’s head is enclosed in a six-pointed star, and surrounded by letters composing the name Rempha, the planetary genius of Saturn, according to the alphabet of the Magi. The bull represents Moloch worship and ultimately, Satan worship. Satanists, Occultist and Freemasons venerate King Solomon, who owned a magic ring that was engraved with the Seal of Solomon, which gave him power over the invisible monarchy of demons. (The History And Practice Of Magic, Vol. 2) The six-pointed star represents Satan, not the Star of David. The Hexagram equates to 666, which Jesus said is the sign of the beast. Sign of the beast is a hexagram, called the star of David It has six points, forms six equilateral triangles, and its interior forms a six-sided hexagon — thus it reveals the number of Satan’s antichrist beast. The 6 points, 6 triangles, and the 6 sides of the hexagon = 666! The Bible attributes the number 666 to Solomon. “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX. ”(Rev. 13:18) “Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX talents of gold...” (1 kings 10:14) So Solomon used the hexagram not David. The Jews in Germany had to wear a star on the outside of their clothes, so that they were easily identified. The hexagram represents Satan worship. Hexagram Satan Goathead Satan ever seeks to establish his worship among the Earth. He even tempted Jesus to bow down and worship him. How much more will he lead people in the end times, either through deceit or enticement, to do the same? Most people aren’t going to worship Satan directly, so he uses other ‘gods’ and ‘idols’, to accept worship indirectly. Throughout the Middle Ages the Seal of Solomon has been used by Arab Magicians, Cabalist Magicians, Druid witches and Satanists. It’s the most powerful symbol used to invoke witchcraft, demons and Satan. Satanism Six-sided star = Hexagram It’s used in magic, witchcraft, sorcery, occultism, alchemy and the casting of zodiacal horoscopes by astrologers. In fact, the word ‘hex‘, as in to put a hex on someone, derives from the word hexagram. According to former Satanist Bill Schnoebelen, who is now a Christian, “a hexagram must be present to call forth a demon” and “it is a very powerful tool to invoke Satan.” It is no mystery that in all the occults, the hex plays a central role in Satan worship and upon and within these covens, human sacrifices are offered to Satan. The hexagram, like the pentagram, is used in practices of the occult and ceremonial magic and is attributed to the 7 “old” planets outlined in astrology. The hexagram represents sun worship, which is Satan worship. Hexagram Solar CalendarThe symbol is linked with sun worship and the sun god which again links back to the Mystery Religions. Deuteronomy 4:19 says “And beware, lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them.” The Satanic Illuminati offers sacrifices to Satan on his revered days, which are based on the cycles of the Sun. 3/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the Spring equinox. 4/19 – A fire sacrifice and a human sacrifice is to be made to the Beast. Note: the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco Branch Davidian siege occurred on this date. 6/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the summer solstice, which is called Litha. 9/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the fall equinox, which is called Mabon. 12/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the winter solstice, which is called Yule. Luciferians revere the hexagram. Luciferians don’t use the name Satan. They believe that Lucifer is the good god, and that the God of the Bible is the evil god. Helena Blavatsky wrote that “Lucifer is the true God“, and she incorporated the hexagram in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, which she founded in 1875. The six-sided star is prominent in their emblem, which includes the Swastika, the Ankh(cross with a circle that represents eternal life), the Aum, and the Ouroboros (an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.). She believed that “There is no religion higher than (Lucifer’s) truth.” “The interlaced triangles, one (lighter) pointing upwards and the other (darker) pointing downwards, symbolise the descent of spirit into matter and its emergence from the confining limits of form. At the same time they suggest the constant conflict between light and dark forces in nature and man. When, as in the emblem, the double triangle is depicted within the circle of the Serpent, the whole of manifested nature is represented, the universe bounded by the limitations of time and space.” Satanists revere the hexagram. Silver Star from Satanist Aleister Crowley Aleister Crowley was a terribly decadent, heroin-addicted, bisexual Satan worshiper, who asked people to call him “The Beast 666.” Crowley believed that he was literally the antimessiah of the apocalypse. He founded the Satanic order of the Silver Star and he designed the unicursal hexagram. His satanic motto was “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Based on those associations, you shouldn’t support anything using the symbol. The Roman Catholic Church, uses the hexagram. As you will see below, the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church reveres the symbol, and every entity that they control uses it too. This includes the Rothchild family, Freemasonry, Zionism, the state of Israel, and false religions. pope-benedict-hexagramHere you can see the Satanic Hexagram prominently placed on the Pope’s mitre. The mitre is shaped like a fish mouth, representing Dagon, the Babylonian fish-god. In the mystery religions, both the forehead and hands were tattooed during rites of initiation, to honor Dagon whose hands and head were cut off by God. Read 1 Samuel 5:1-5 The state of St. Peter at the Vatican features a Satanic hexagram. St. Peter Statue At Vatican With Hexagram. This statue of Peter at the Vatican features the supposed keys to the church and a disguised hexagram. Most people wouldn’t notice the six points, which form the hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church falsely claims that the church was founded by Peter the Apostle. The Satanic hexagram could not represent the true church. And Jesus told us in Revelation that 666 represents the Antichrist beast. . This Pope’s Monstrance features a hexagram surrounded by a Sun symbol. The hexagram is disguised, as most people don’t understand the meaning of the six points on this monstrance. It clearly forms a hexagram, and it has the wafer, the supposed body of Christ, right in the middle of the Satanic symbol. The hexagram is a curse mark, so in essence, this is cursing the body of Christ. Notice that the Sun waves have six-sided stars on them too. St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago features a hexagram. St. Cantius Catholic Church HexagramHere is a hexagram with the Chi-Rho symbol in the middle. It is on the floor of the St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. The Roman Catholic Church Chi-Rho symbol represents the hexagram. Roman Catholic Church Chi Rho Symbol Is 666 HexagramThe Chi-Rho was the Mark of the Roman Empire. It has six points which form a hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church uses the Chi-Rho symbol, as an alternative to the hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Rothchild family uses the Hexagram. The Rothchild family is controlled by the Jesuits, who are the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 17th century, the family changed their last name from Bauer to Rothchild, which means ‘red-shield‘, as family patriarch Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it. Rothchild family crest with Hexagram mark of the beast The red hexagram was patterned after the red Seal of Solomon. The Rothschild’s are Satanists who used this powerful magic symbol in their coat-of-arms. Since 1823, the Rothchilds have controlled the vast financial holdings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Rothchild family is ultra-wealthy because their banking schemes have stolen the wealth of the nations, including the U.S. via the Federal Reserve Bank. They are gathering the world’s wealth, so that they can control the one-world monetary system. They have hundreds of trillions of dollars, and they control the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements in Switzerland, and the central banks of nearly every county in the world. The compass of Freemasonry represents a hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Illuminati infiltrated the order of Freemasonry to use it as a front-organization, to promote their Satanic agenda to create a New World Order. Freemasonry Compass Is A Hexagram You see the hexagram shape hidden in their compass and ruler design, and on their temples. At the lower levels, Freemasons are not made aware of the Satanic secret society. At the 32nd and 33rd degrees of Freemasonry, their god is revealed as Lucifer the light-bearer. The six-pointed “Blazing Star” points to the true deity they worship, Lucifer. Through the Freemasons, the evil elite draw in the best people in society, and promote the ones who conform to their will. This helps them build levels of control, as these people run corporations and governments. King Solomon is the most important figure in Freemasonry, because he fell away from God and worshiped false gods, and he used the six-sided star to invoke the powers of Satan. So how did the Satanic hexagram end up on the state of Israel’s flag? Now that you know that the six-sided star is not really the Star of David, and you know that it is a Satanic symbol, how could it possibly represent a country of people that is referred to as God’s chosen people? The Rothchild’s funded the Zionist movement to create the state of Israel. The state of Israel is controlled by the Jesuits, the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church, through the Rothchild family. In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visited Palestine and subsequently supplied the funds to buy a great deal of property from the Turks and Arabs, to found the first Jewish colonies in Palestine. In 1897, the Rothschild’s founded the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state). The “Rothschild Hexagram” was put on the Zionist flag, which 51 years later ended up on the flag of Israel. The Jesuits engineered WWI and waited until 1917 when Britain was in trouble. They then promised the British Government that they could get the US to enter WWI (on the side of Britain) and thus ensure Britain’s victory of Germany et al. However, they wanted something in return: Palestine. Thus the Balfour Declaration was created, which is an official letter from the British Government Foreign Secretary James Balfour to Baron Rothschild. It states that: ”His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object.” They needed Jews to move to Israel to make it all look legit, so they caused persecution of Jews in Germany during WWII, to get them to move to Palestine. The Jesuits needed the land of Israel to be able to control the Middle East oil reserves, and as you’ve seen, with the help of the U.S., Iraq and Libya’s oil reserves were given to the elite, and an oil pipeline was run through Afghanistan. They also needed to be able to overthrow the leaders of Islamic countries, to replace them with Jesuit-controlled puppets, who will help bring each country into the New World Order. The U.S. has helped remove the leaders in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, etc., and the leaders of Syria and Iran are in the cross-hairs. Ultimately, the Jesuits needed control of the land of Israel to be able to position their end times False Messiah in Jerusalem, which is central to the three major religions. The Satanic Rothchild’s put the hexagram on Israel’s flag instead of a menorah. When the Flag of Israel was unveiled, it was met with tremendous opposition from Jews who realize this Hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions as the symbol of Moloch. The emblem on the flag is a blue colored version of the Rothschild, “Red Hexagram or Sign.” The star is on the flag, because the Rothchild’s own and control the state of Israel. The six-pointed star on Israel’s flag represents Satan, not the Star of David. Today, every major religion uses the Hexagram. Buddhism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Hinduism Shatkona hexagram Buddhism: HexagrOM symbol:- “OM Mani Padme Hum” is the oldest and most important mantra of Tibetan Buddhism, usually translated from Sanskrit as “OM, jewel in the lotus, hum”. The ‘jewel in the lotus‘ may be considered as enlightenment arising in the lotus of human consciousness. This is the holiest of Tibetan mantras, associated with the bodhisattva (“enlightened being”) Avalokiteshvara, and is an expression of compassion as well as a longing for liberation and enlightenment. Hinduism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Buddism hexagram = Shiva + Shakti + Murugan In the Hindu religion, the hexagram is called the Shatkona, and is equivalent to the symbolism in ritual magic. The Shatkona is the combination of the Shiva kona (trikona, triangle), the symbol of the God Shiva, representing the element of fire, and the Shakti kona, representing the element of water. The two components symbolize man’s position between earth and sky. Together, they represent the union of male and female, and the heart chakra. Islam, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram in mosques. Hexagram in a Cube The symbol is known in Arabic as the Najmat Dawud (Star of David) or Khatem Sulayman (Seal of Solomon), It is present in Islam mosques, on the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is geometrically represented in a cube, which Muslims worship in Mecca at the Kabbah Allah black cube. In various places in the Qur’an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, Suliman or Sulayman) were prophets and kings and therefore they are revered figures by Muslims. Mormonism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Mormon Salt Lake City Temple Hexagram The hexagram is also used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. They say it symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. In reality, they are a false religion that was created by the Freemasons, who are controlled by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Church. The hexagram is used by New Agers, who are Antichrist. new-age-hexagram It’s used on their COEXIST bumper stickers, which prepares the world to put away the differences of their religion in the name of peace. Stars like Bono of U2 promote the COEXIST theme, to mislead people. In the New World Order, there will only be one religion, and those who cling to their beliefs in Jesus as the only way to God, will be persecuted. King Solomon’s reign was so peaceful and prosperous that he was thought to be the Messiah. Jews are being led to expect that their Messiah will be a priest-king who is the reincarnation of Solomon. Muslims, Jews, Christians and many other religions, look to Solomon as their forefather. Solomon is primarily revered by the occult societies because he led the nation of Israel away from the worship of the true God into the worship of pagan gods. Christians have been deceived regarding the Satanic power behind the hexagram. The Messianic movement heavily promotes the Star of David. False prophets such as John Hagee use the symbol. This most occult of all symbols is worn as a charm by countless Christians who naively believe that it is a harmless token representing the chosen people of God, and hope that it will bring a kind of blessing on themselves. Those who speak against it are labeled “racist” and “anti-Semitic” due to the world’s misconception that the six-pointed star is Jewish. We must conclude then, that it is an apostate symbol belonging to the occult and totally foreign to Christianity. No true Christian should use it in any manner or fashion, as it is tied to Satan and to the Antichrist beast. The Satanic hexagram is used throughout our cultures. As you go about your life, notice how many times the Hexagram shows up on TV, print, etc. The hexagram shows up in America because the Jesuits control us. Hexagram on the Dollar Bill On the One Dollar bill, a hexagram is formed when the outline of the pyramid and surrounding letters is traced.The Jesuits symbols and words are on the One Dollar bill because they control the Federal Reserve, the I.R.S. and the U.S. Dept. of Treasury. The Star of David Hexagram is on the Great Seal of the Dollar Here it is on the Great Seal of the One Dollar bill. It is above the eagle’s head, formed by 13 stars. The evil elite love the number 13. There’s also 13 leaves, 13 arrows, 13 red/white stripes and 13 tail feathers. Education 2000 Summit features the Star of David Hexagram. This is the logo of the Goals 2000 Education Curriculum implemented under the Clinton administration. All six points focus on self-glorification through the tree of knowledge. Look closely and you will see three 6’s in the logo, where the inner circle spins off three times. The Bristol Myer Squibb logo has the star of David Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company that provides drug therapy instead of prevention.Their logo features the hexagram, through it is hidden, so a faint red background was added to help you see it. Medicine Ambulance EMS Hexagram Symbol The Star of Life featuring a serpent on a pole should give you a clue.The Jesuits have taken control of our medical care by controlling the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association, to promote a drug-oriented science, not basic ‘preventative’ nutrition. The Jesuit-controlled Zionists use it to promote the state of Israel. AIPAC Star of David AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is a Roman Catholic Church Jesuit front organization that lobbies to ensure U.S. support of Israel. This allows them to control the Middle East, to steal the resources, to overthrow dictators who don’t conform to their will, and to deceive Christians about the Jews. World Jewish Congress Star of David The World Jewish Congress is a Roman Catholic Church Jesuit front organization that lobbies to ensure world-wide support of Israel.The hexagram was adopted by the Zionist Organization at the First Zionist Congress in 1897. . The Jesuit-controlled Freemasons use the hexagram. Freemasons Baden Powell Royal Arch Chapter uses the Star of David This is the Freemasonry symbol of the Baden Powell Royal Arch Chapter. Freemasonry Prince Henry the Navigator Chapter uses the Star of David Hexagram This is the Freemasonry symbol of the Prince Henry the Navigator Chapter. Freemasonry Star of David This Freemasons symbol says “Si talia jungere possis sit tibi scire satis“, which means “If thou canst; comprehend these things, thou knowest enough,” which once again focuses on Satan’s Tree of Knowledge instead of the Tree of Life of the true God. The hexagram has been used in many cultures throughout history. The hexagram can be found on coins, buildings, statues, paintings, etc., in Arabia, Carthage, Constantinople, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, Romania, Rome, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Wales.

Deuteronomy 4:19 says “And beware, lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them.” The Satanic Illuminati offers sacrifices to Satan on his revered days, which are based on the cycles of the Sun. 3/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the Spring equinox. 4/19 – A fire sacrifice and a human sacrifice is to be made to the Beast. Note: the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco Branch Davidian siege occurred on this date. 6/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the summer solstice, which is called Litha. 9/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the fall equinox, which is called Mabon. 12/21 – A human sacrifice is required on the winter solstice, which is called Yule. Luciferians revere the hexagram. Luciferians don’t use the name Satan. They believe that Lucifer is the good god, and that the God of the Bible is the evil god. Helena Blavatsky wrote that “Lucifer is the true God“, and she incorporated the hexagram in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, which she founded in 1875. The six-sided star is prominent in their emblem, which includes the Swastika, the Ankh(cross with a circle that represents eternal life), the Aum, and the Ouroboros (an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.). She believed that “There is no religion higher than (Lucifer’s) truth.” “The interlaced triangles, one (lighter) pointing upwards and the other (darker) pointing downwards, symbolise the descent of spirit into matter and its emergence from the confining limits of form. At the same time they suggest the constant conflict between light and dark forces in nature and man. When, as in the emblem, the double triangle is depicted within the circle of the Serpent, the whole of manifested nature is represented, the universe bounded by the limitations of time and space.” Satanists revere the hexagram. Silver Star from Satanist Aleister Crowley Aleister Crowley was a terribly decadent, heroin-addicted, bisexual Satan worshiper, who asked people to call him “The Beast 666.” Crowley believed that he was literally the antimessiah of the apocalypse. He founded the Satanic order of the Silver Star and he designed the unicursal hexagram. His satanic motto was “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Based on those associations, you shouldn’t support anything using the symbol. The Roman Catholic Church, uses the hexagram. As you will see below, the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church reveres the symbol, and every entity that they control uses it too. This includes the Rothchild family, Freemasonry, Zionism, the state of Israel, and false religions. pope-benedict-hexagramHere you can see the Satanic Hexagram prominently placed on the Pope’s mitre. The mitre is shaped like a fish mouth, representing Dagon, the Babylonian fish-god. In the mystery religions, both the forehead and hands were tattooed during rites of initiation, to honor Dagon whose hands and head were cut off by God. Read 1 Samuel 5:1-5 The state of St. Peter at the Vatican features a Satanic hexagram. St. Peter Statue At Vatican With Hexagram. This statue of Peter at the Vatican features the supposed keys to the church and a disguised hexagram. Most people wouldn’t notice the six points, which form the hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church falsely claims that the church was founded by Peter the Apostle. The Satanic hexagram could not represent the true church. And Jesus told us in Revelation that 666 represents the Antichrist beast. . This Pope’s Monstrance features a hexagram surrounded by a Sun symbol. The hexagram is disguised, as most people don’t understand the meaning of the six points on this monstrance. It clearly forms a hexagram, and it has the wafer, the supposed body of Christ, right in the middle of the Satanic symbol. The hexagram is a curse mark, so in essence, this is cursing the body of Christ. Notice that the Sun waves have six-sided stars on them too. St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago features a hexagram. St. Cantius Catholic Church HexagramHere is a hexagram with the Chi-Rho symbol in the middle. It is on the floor of the St. John Cantius Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. The Roman Catholic Church Chi-Rho symbol represents the hexagram. Roman Catholic Church Chi Rho Symbol Is 666 HexagramThe Chi-Rho was the Mark of the Roman Empire. It has six points which form a hexagram. The Roman Catholic Church uses the Chi-Rho symbol, as an alternative to the hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Rothchild family uses the Hexagram. The Rothchild family is controlled by the Jesuits, who are the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 17th century, the family changed their last name from Bauer to Rothchild, which means ‘red-shield‘, as family patriarch Mayer Amschel Bauer began hanging out a red hexagram in front of their house to identify it. Rothchild family crest with Hexagram mark of the beast The red hexagram was patterned after the red Seal of Solomon. The Rothschild’s are Satanists who used this powerful magic symbol in their coat-of-arms. Since 1823, the Rothchilds have controlled the vast financial holdings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Rothchild family is ultra-wealthy because their banking schemes have stolen the wealth of the nations, including the U.S. via the Federal Reserve Bank. They are gathering the world’s wealth, so that they can control the one-world monetary system. They have hundreds of trillions of dollars, and they control the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements in Switzerland, and the central banks of nearly every county in the world. The compass of Freemasonry represents a hexagram. The Jesuit-controlled Illuminati infiltrated the order of Freemasonry to use it as a front-organization, to promote their Satanic agenda to create a New World Order. Freemasonry Compass Is A Hexagram You see the hexagram shape hidden in their compass and ruler design, and on their temples. At the lower levels, Freemasons are not made aware of the Satanic secret society. At the 32nd and 33rd degrees of Freemasonry, their god is revealed as Lucifer the light-bearer. The six-pointed “Blazing Star” points to the true deity they worship, Lucifer. Through the Freemasons, the evil elite draw in the best people in society, and promote the ones who conform to their will. This helps them build levels of control, as these people run corporations and governments. King Solomon is the most important figure in Freemasonry, because he fell away from God and worshiped false gods, and he used the six-sided star to invoke the powers of Satan. So how did the Satanic hexagram end up on the state of Israel’s flag? Now that you know that the six-sided star is not really the Star of David, and you know that it is a Satanic symbol, how could it possibly represent a country of people that is referred to as God’s chosen people? The Rothchild’s funded the Zionist movement to create the state of Israel. The state of Israel is controlled by the Jesuits, the covert military arm of the Roman Catholic Church, through the Rothchild family. In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visited Palestine and subsequently supplied the funds to buy a great deal of property from the Turks and Arabs, to found the first Jewish colonies in Palestine. In 1897, the Rothschild’s founded the Zionist Congress to promote Zionism (a political movement with the sole aim of moving all Jews into a singularly Jewish nation state). The “Rothschild Hexagram” was put on the Zionist flag, which 51 years later ended up on the flag of Israel. The Jesuits engineered WWI and waited until 1917 when Britain was in trouble. They then promised the British Government that they could get the US to enter WWI (on the side of Britain) and thus ensure Britain’s victory of Germany et al. However, they wanted something in return: Palestine. Thus the Balfour Declaration was created, which is an official letter from the British Government Foreign Secretary James Balfour to Baron Rothschild. It states that: ”His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object.” They needed Jews to move to Israel to make it all look legit, so they caused persecution of Jews in Germany during WWII, to get them to move to Palestine. The Jesuits needed the land of Israel to be able to control the Middle East oil reserves, and as you’ve seen, with the help of the U.S., Iraq and Libya’s oil reserves were given to the elite, and an oil pipeline was run through Afghanistan. They also needed to be able to overthrow the leaders of Islamic countries, to replace them with Jesuit-controlled puppets, who will help bring each country into the New World Order. The U.S. has helped remove the leaders in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, etc., and the leaders of Syria and Iran are in the cross-hairs. Ultimately, the Jesuits needed control of the land of Israel to be able to position their end times False Messiah in Jerusalem, which is central to the three major religions. The Satanic Rothchild’s put the hexagram on Israel’s flag instead of a menorah. When the Flag of Israel was unveiled, it was met with tremendous opposition from Jews who realize this Hexagram was used in the ancient mystery religions as the symbol of Moloch. The emblem on the flag is a blue colored version of the Rothschild, “Red Hexagram or Sign.” The star is on the flag, because the Rothchild’s own and control the state of Israel. The six-pointed star on Israel’s flag represents Satan, not the Star of David. Today, every major religion uses the Hexagram. Buddhism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Hinduism Shatkona hexagram Buddhism: HexagrOM symbol:- “OM Mani Padme Hum” is the oldest and most important mantra of Tibetan Buddhism, usually translated from Sanskrit as “OM, jewel in the lotus, hum”. The ‘jewel in the lotus‘ may be considered as enlightenment arising in the lotus of human consciousness. This is the holiest of Tibetan mantras, associated with the bodhisattva (“enlightened being”) Avalokiteshvara, and is an expression of compassion as well as a longing for liberation and enlightenment. Hinduism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Buddism hexagram = Shiva + Shakti + Murugan In the Hindu religion, the hexagram is called the Shatkona, and is equivalent to the symbolism in ritual magic. The Shatkona is the combination of the Shiva kona (trikona, triangle), the symbol of the God Shiva, representing the element of fire, and the Shakti kona, representing the element of water. The two components symbolize man’s position between earth and sky. Together, they represent the union of male and female, and the heart chakra. Islam, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram in mosques. Hexagram in a Cube The symbol is known in Arabic as the Najmat Dawud (Star of David) or Khatem Sulayman (Seal of Solomon), It is present in Islam mosques, on the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is geometrically represented in a cube, which Muslims worship in Mecca at the Kabbah Allah black cube. In various places in the Qur’an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, Suliman or Sulayman) were prophets and kings and therefore they are revered figures by Muslims. Mormonism, which denies Jesus Christ as God, uses the hexagram. Mormon Salt Lake City Temple Hexagram The hexagram is also used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. They say it symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. In reality, they are a false religion that was created by the Freemasons, who are controlled by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Church. The hexagram is used by New Agers, who are Antichrist. new-age-hexagram It’s used on their COEXIST bumper stickers, which prepares the world to put away the differences of their religion in the name of peace. Stars like Bono of U2 promote the COEXIST theme, to mislead people. In the New World Order, there will only be one religion, and those who cling to their beliefs in Jesus as the only way to God, will be persecuted. King Solomon’s reign was so peaceful and prosperous that he was thought to be the Messiah. Jews are being led to expect that their Messiah will be a priest-king who is the reincarnation of Solomon. Muslims, Jews, Christians and many other religions, look to Solomon as their forefather. Solomon is primarily revered by the occult societies because he led the nation of Israel away from the worship of the true God into the worship of pagan gods. Christians have been deceived regarding the Satanic power behind the hexagram. The Messianic movement heavily promotes the Star of David. False prophets such as John Hagee use the symbol. This most occult of all symbols is worn as a charm by countless Christians who naively believe that it is a harmless token representing the chosen people of God, and hope that it will bring a kind of blessing on themselves. Those who speak against it are labeled “racist” and “anti-Semitic” due to the world’s misconception that the six-pointed star is Jewish. We must conclude then, that it is an apostate symbol belonging to the occult and totally foreign to Christianity. No true Christian should use it in any manner or fashion, as it is tied to Satan and to the Antichrist beast. The Satanic hexagram is used throughout our cultures. As you go about your life, notice how many times the Hexagram shows up on TV, print, etc. The hexagram shows up in America because the Jesuits control us. Hexagram on the Dollar Bill On the One Dollar bill, a hexagram is formed when the outline of the pyramid and surrounding letters is traced.The Jesuits symbols and words are on the One Dollar bill because they control the Federal Reserve, the I.R.S. and the U.S. Dept. of Treasury. The Star of David Hexagram is on the Great Seal of the Dollar Here it is on the Great Seal of the One Dollar bill. It is above the eagle’s head, formed by 13 stars. The evil elite love the number 13. There’s also 13 leaves, 13 arrows, 13 red/white stripes and 13 tail feathers. Education 2000 Summit features the Star of David Hexagram. This is the logo of the Goals 2000 Education Curriculum implemented under the Clinton administration. All six points focus on self-glorification through the tree of knowledge. Look closely and you will see three 6’s in the logo, where the inner circle spins off three times. The Bristol Myer Squibb logo has the star of David Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company that provides drug therapy instead of prevention.Their logo features the hexagram, through it is hidden, so a faint red background was added to help you see it. Medicine Ambulance EMS Hexagram Symbol The Star of Life featuring a serpent on a pole should give you a clue.The Jesuits have taken control of our medical care by controlling the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association, to promote a drug-oriented science, not basic ‘preventative’ nutrition. The Jesuit-controlled Zionists use it to promote the state of Israel. AIPAC Star of David AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is a Roman Catholic Church Jesuit front organization that lobbies to ensure U.S. support of Israel. This allows them to control the Middle East, to steal the resources, to overthrow dictators who don’t conform to their will, and to deceive Christians about the Jews. World Jewish Congress Star of David The World Jewish Congress is a Roman Catholic Church Jesuit front organization that lobbies to ensure world-wide support of Israel.The hexagram was adopted by the Zionist Organization at the First Zionist Congress in 1897. . The Jesuit-controlled Freemasons use the hexagram. Freemasons Baden Powell Royal Arch Chapter uses the Star of David This is the Freemasonry symbol of the Baden Powell Royal Arch Chapter. Freemasonry Prince Henry the Navigator Chapter uses the Star of David Hexagram This is the Freemasonry symbol of the Prince Henry the Navigator Chapter. Freemasonry Star of David This Freemasons symbol says “Si talia jungere possis sit tibi scire satis“, which means “If thou canst; comprehend these things, thou knowest enough,” which once again focuses on Satan’s Tree of Knowledge instead of the Tree of Life of the true God. The hexagram has been used in many cultures throughout history. The hexagram can be found on coins, buildings, statues, paintings, etc., in Arabia, Carthage, Constantinople, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, Romania, Rome, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Wales.

Both phones offer flagship-grade photography, but each approaches imaging differently—Samsung focuses on versatility and zoom power, while Apple prioritizes natural colors, consistency, and video excellence. Here’s a full 500-word analysis to help you understand which camera truly fits your needs. The Samsung S26 Ultra boasts a powerful quad-camera system: a 200MP primary sensor, a high-resolution 50MP ultra-wide lens, and two telephoto lenses including a periscope zoom with up to 5× optical zoom and beyond with hybrid enhancement. This setup makes the S26 Ultra one of the most flexible mobile cameras available. Samsung’s larger sensor and pixel-binning technologies allow the phone to capture massive detail, especially in bright light. The iPhone 16 Pro Max, meanwhile, features a triple-camera system with a 48MP main sensor, a 48MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens with up to 5× optical zoom. Apple combines these sensors with its advanced computational photography engine, giving users consistently excellent results with minimal effort. Though the megapixel count is lower than Samsung’s, Apple's sensor quality and software algorithms make a huge difference in real-world shots. #fblifestyles #trendingreelsvideo #S26Ultra #iPhone16ProMax #SamsungVsApple #CameraComparison #S26UltravsiPhone16ProMax #SmartphoneCameraTest #CameraBattle2025 #TechComparison #MobilePhotography #SamsungCamera","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/831378509791866","likes":71,"shares":0,"comments":3,"views":0}

She was 88 when mesothelioma — a rare cancer caused by asbestos — claimed her life. The killer wasn’t hidden in an industrial site or a chemical plant. It sat on her bathroom shelf: Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder. On October 7th, 2025, a Los Angeles jury ruled what insiders have known for decades — J&J’s talc was poisoned, and they knew it. They marketed it to mothers, children, and minority communities as “pure,” “gentle,” and “safe,” all while internal memos dating back to the 1970s confirmed asbestos contamination. The verdict: $966 million to her family. The message: the age of pharmaceutical untouchability is over. For half a century, they buried the evidence. Suppressed whistleblowers. Paid scientists. Manipulated studies. And when the lawsuits started piling up — over 67,000 of them — they tried to hide behind bankruptcy shields. Every attempt failed. Now the truth is bleeding into the open: this was not negligence. It was corporate homicide disguised as consumer care. But this case isn’t just about one product. It’s the blueprint of an entire system built to profit from slow death. The pharmaceutical empire — in lockstep with Big Food and Big Tech — has quietly waged war on the human body itself. They don’t create cures; they manufacture dependency. Every pill, every shot, every “approved” formula chips away at the mitochondria — the cell’s core engine of life, immunity, and healing. Look around: exhaustion, infertility, early-onset cancer, autoimmune collapse — it’s not random. It’s the byproduct of an orchestrated assault. Fluoridated water. Seed oils. Synthetic hormones. EMF radiation. All different fronts of the same war — a war against energy. Because a healthy, energized population is impossible to control. Now, the tide is shifting. People are abandoning the system, seeking ways to rebuild from the inside. Natural formulations like Mitolyn are emerging as weapons of resistance — restoring mitochondrial strength, boosting energy, and reversing decades of damage. When energy returns, the spell breaks. The machine stops feeding. And that’s what terrifies the establishment. This verdict happened because the old shield — the political one — is gone. Under Trump’s restored administration, health agencies are being audited, whistleblowers protected, and the pharmaceutical state finally cornered. The same giants that manipulated the world through “public health” are now facing the first wave of true accountability. Johnson & Johnson is only the beginning. Pfizer, Moderna, Bayer, and their enablers at the FDA and CDC are next. The curtain is lifting. The era of corporate immunity is collapsing. Humanity is waking up to the truth: vitality is power, and energy is freedom.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10164647545614691","likes":30,"shares":23,"comments":8,"views":0}

Why yes ma’am, Benadryl. You know that medication you take FOR allergies. Yep right here. Hives, swelling the whole nine yards… chronic medical conditions… shiiiitt… I have chronic kidney disease, sooo you got a kidney to spare, because this bitch ain’t doing dialysis. I got 2 blood clotting disorders which landed me in the hospital that I signed out AMA from when I got a pulmonary embolism because im a single mom and cant afford that shit, so yeah, my breathing… not too great. I am all out of my refills for my eliquis and since I don’t have a primary care physician maybe I should just get a life insurance policy to be safe. My heart. Shitty! Mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation and I have a lesion on my liver and a nodule on my lung… wait I’m sorry, did I follow up with Hillman Cancer Center like I was supposed to? No ma’am I am a single mother. I don’t have time for that! And, not to mention, I believe if I do have cancer, I don’t want to know! That shit will kill me faster than COVID when it first started… because I’m just going to keep telling myself. Man, you have cancer and you’re dying and then BOOM. Dead. So I wake up everyday telling myself, “bitch, you got this. You are strong and you are not going to die today.” Fast forward through all my trauma and sad bullshit of my first memory being molested when I was 4 and being oriented to a court room when everyone else my age was being oriented to school. Did I graduate? Well no ma’am I got pregnant when I was 15 and I gave up my life for my kids, but got my GED and became an RN. I lost a son to SIDS and my daughter had more brain surgeries than I ever thought I’d have to witness and endure with her. Legal stuff? Psssh! Not until this year when my ADULT son spit in my face and I grabbed ahold of him like every parent would and then my daughter, who is missing her right frontal lobe, left the house without me knowing when she knew I was sleeping! My son who doesn’t live with me let the cops in after I worked all day and I woke up not knowing what was going on and refused to put my youngest daughter down because I was scared to death and had no IDEA what was going on and ended up getting a resisting arrest and simple assault. And am fighting TWO child endangerment charges even though I didn’t knowlingly or willingly cause danger or harm to any of my children (not to mention my one is an ADULT) and I lost my job and now I’m trying to take it to trial so I can continue being a nurse and a good mom to my kids that I’d give my LIFE for… Her: wow thats a lot. Are you having thoughts to harm yourself? No ma’am. But I do have to tell you I’m pretty bummed out when I wake up in the morning and the world hasn’t ended. That rapture sure is taking its time. I know I’d feel a lot better with God judging me than 12 jurors who don’t know me for Adam. Them (over an hour later): well, wow we sure have a lot more to cover, but that’s all the time we have. Me: yes, I understand. My life is quite the shit show. You’re welcome 😅😬💁🏼‍♀️","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1857129204907085","likes":50,"shares":0,"comments":42,"views":0}

Nonprofit hospitals and health clinics are alarmed about a change that's coming to federal drug purchasing discounts next year. They'll have to pay up front and then get rebates — rather than direct price cuts — in a pilot with eight pharmaceutical companies. Why it matters: The new system, greenlit by the Trump administration, is a win for drugmakers, and it could be a big hassle for providers. Under the test, which starts in January, providers will pay full price for drugs they currently get at a steep discount. They'll get reimbursed the difference after the drugmaker determines they qualify for the lower price under the 340B program, which allows nonprofit safety net providers to access lower-cost outpatient drugs. What they're saying: \"Many hospitals are concerned about cash flow around this,\" Maureen Testoni, CEO of the provider trade group 340B Health, said on a recent call with reporters. Providers will have to hire new staff to submit data to get the rebates, or at least shift employee responsibilities around, she said. She noted that the change comes as providers prepare for cuts to Medicaid reimbursement and other likely changes that could reduce their Medicare payments. Where it stands: The Health Resources and Services Administration last week approved 340B rebate programs for nine popular drugs, including Bristol Myers Squibb's blood thinner Eliquis and Janssen's Stelara and Xarelto. The pilot will run for at least one year to test whether rebates work for 340B discounts, HHS said in July when it first announced the idea. PhRMA sees the rebate pilot as a step toward more transparency and accountability in the 340B program, senior director of public affairs Molly Jenkins said in a statement. The administration should go further and allow rebates across all 340B-covered outpatient drugs, Jenkins added. Several pharmaceutical companies have tried to implement their own rebate systems in recent years, arguing they guard against providers getting duplicate discounts or diverting 340B drugs to ineligible patients. Courts have so far blocked them from doing so without HHS approval. Yes, but: The nonprofit health system Advocate Health says the savings from direct discounts allow it to invest $6 billion annually into free clinics, charity care and community-based programs. \"A shift to a rebate model, as opposed to the current discount model, would undercut our ability to continue this level of care,\" the health system's leaders wrote in a comment letter to HHS earlier this year. The rebate model \"is a clear case of the fox guarding the hen house,\" Jennifer DeCubellis, CEO of America's Essential Hospitals, said in a statement, adding that \"drug manufacturers are the only winners\" of the program. The other side: HHS maintains that the pilot is a limited, data-driven effort to improve 340B, press secretary Emily Hilliard told Axios via email. HHS is undertaking the project to \"better understand the merits and shortcomings of the rebate model from the perspective of affected stakeholders,\" she wrote.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/10236027424738084","likes":0,"shares":0,"comments":2,"views":0,"text_altered":"Grrrrr president trump!!

I am literally indebted with my life to this lady who had faith in us to co-sponsor him. You are our hero, my lifeline, our hope Joy Liebfreund Seagraves. Muchisimas gracias de mi corazon! I have been getting treatment at The OSU James Cancer Center for follicular lymphoma (FL) cancer since 2020. I have failed three types of chemo and my FL has transformed into aggressive diffuse large b cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Cancer has progressed to my lungs. It was not possible for me to start with Breyanzi CAR-T treatment unless I could guarantee to my hematologist that I had someone with me 24/7 for a minimum of one month (given any unforeseen circumstances). This procedure called \"apheresis\" begins on December 5th with extracting my t-cells (via a pic line) for submission to Bristol Meyers Squibb (BMS) for genetic modification in their laboratory. This is to make a man-made protein on the surface of the cell called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). These receptors are designed to bind the surface of the cancer cells, which lets the modified T cells attack them like Pacman. The CAR-T cells fight the cancer and help protect against the return of cancer. The CAR-T cells are multiplied, frozen and sent back to the hospital. During this process I will continue to have cycles of chemo to get rid of the remaining cancerous T cells. After the T-Cells are received from BMS, I will receive them as an outpatient. This process is not without serious risks of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), neurological toxicity, risks of infection and/or other side effects, hence, the reason for having someone by my side 24/7. We must live within 30 minutes of the clinic in the event of a crisis. The James will provide our hotel stay in Columbus. The risks are very frightening but it is our hope that CAR-T will allow me more time with Ramon as there is no cure for blood cancer. I appreciate all the love, support and prayers that you all have provided. Please don't stop now as this new chapter will be a delicate process. Pray with us that there will be no or few complications and limited stress for Ramon as my caretaker. We appreciate your support in my previous post \"We Got This\" to help with expenses and needs while in Columbus without cooking facilities and in our journey in the road ahead. I would be remiss not to acknowledge the help of Ellen, immigration case manager, in Senator Bernie Moreno's office. Her patience and perseverance in communicating with me and the US Embassy in Santo Domingo enabled Ramon to receive an expedited family visa (though we had been in this process for 6 disappointing years). Also, with the help of letters and the pathology report from my doctor, Ramon is with me. He is 100% legal in the US with a green card and social security card to work when that time comes. For now, our focus is on my health. That will be a job in itself! LOL! To this end, if it weren't for Joy's sponsorship of Ramon, my hope of an extended life would not be possible. Ohh, we give our gratitude to all who have donated winter clothes to Ramon. He arrived with a small luggage full of summer clothes. He is now prepared for winter, thanks to many. Our first snowfall he was like a little kid running from window to window to see the snow and calling all his family on Messenger live chat to show them the white stuff. It brought me so much happiness! So much to be thankful for! Give Thanks To Life and Great Friends! We Got This! We love you, Joy!","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/3604410229699998","likes":41,"shares":3,"comments":141,"views":0}

AI Overview +6 Understanding CAR-T cell therapy for cancer: Mayo Clinic ... CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that genetically engineers a patient's own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. The process involves collecting a patient's T cells, modifying them in a lab to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), growing them, and then infusing them back into the patient to target and kill cancer cells. This treatment has been effective against certain blood cancers, like lymphoma and leukemia, even when other treatments have failed. How it works Collection: A patient's T cells are collected from their blood. Modification: The T cells are genetically engineered in a lab to create CAR T cells. These cells are equipped with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that helps them identify and bind to a specific protein on the surface of cancer cells. Expansion: The CAR T cells are grown in large numbers in the lab. Infusion: The CAR T cells are infused back into the patient's bloodstream. Attack: The CAR T cells find and destroy the cancer cells. What it treats CAR T-cell therapy is used to treat certain types of cancer, including some forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Important considerations It is a form of cell-based gene therapy. Some patients may experience significant side effects, such as confusion, seizures, or brain swelling, which require close monitoring. It is not effective for all patients, and some may experience a relapse after the treatment.

This clinical trial, TROPION-Breast 05, is specifically designed for metastatic patients with PD-L1 positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer as a first-line treatment (meaning this is your first treatment for metastatic TNBC). This trial combines DATROWAY with an immunotherapy drug called Durvalumab (a drug similar to Keytruda). Science is constantly advancing and there are currently limited options for TNBC. The goal of this trial is to see if combining the new targeted drug, DATROWAY, with Durvalumab works more effectively than and/or provides another treatment option versus the current standard treatment (Chemotherapy + Keytruda) for metastatic patients with PD-L1 positive TNBC. if this is confusing to you, just watch this episode and we will put a hug around this science for you. The really good news here is that we have another much-needed treatment option for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

News News News @NewsNew97351204 Breaking News Scientists discover Pfizer COVID jab linked to major eye damage If you have had a similar reaction to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, email chris.melore@dailymail.com with your story Scientists have discovered that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine may increase the risk of eye damage, leading to vision loss. The new study specifically examined how the vaccine affected patients' corneas, the clear front part of the eye that allows light to enter. In 64 people, scientists in Turkey measured changes in the cornea's inner layer, called the endothelium, before taking the first Pfizer dose and two months after receiving the second. Results revealed that taking both doses of the vaccine led to thicker corneas, fewer endothelial cells in the eye and more variation in size of these specialized cells that form the endothelium. In the short term, these changes suggest the Pfizer vaccine may temporarily weaken the endothelium, even though patients didn't suffer clear vision problems during the study. For people with healthy eyes, these small changes likely won't affect vision right away. However, if scientists find that these changes last for years, they could lead to corneal swelling or blurry vision, especially in those with pre-existing eye problems or people who have had a cornea transplant. A thicker cornea and reduced cell density could contribute to eye conditions like corneal edema, bullous keratopathy, or corneal decompensation, which can all cause permanent vision loss in severe cases, especially if left untreated.

Here's a clear overview: ### What is a BMS? A Building Management System is an integrated computer-based control system installed in buildings that monitors and controls the building’s mechanical and electrical equipment such as: - HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) - Lighting - Power systems - Fire systems - Security systems (access control, CCTV) - Lifts/elevators - Water supply and plumbing - Energy metering ### Main Functions of a BMS 1. Centralized Control – Operators can monitor and control all systems from a single interface (usually a software dashboard). 2. Energy Management – Optimizes energy use (e.g., turns off lights/HVAC in unoccupied areas, adjusts temperature setpoints). 3. Alarm Management – Detects faults (e.g., pump failure, high room temperature) and alerts operators. 4. Data Logging & Trending – Records historical data for analysis and reporting. 5. Scheduling – Automates routines (e.g., office lights on at 7 AM, off at 7 PM). 6. Remote Access – Many modern BMS allow control via web or mobile apps. ### Common BMS Protocols - BACnet (most widely used open protocol) - Modbus - LonWorks - KNX - DALI (for lighting) - OPC ### Major BMS Manufacturers/Brands - Siemens (Desigo) - Honeywell (EBI, ComfortPoint) - Schneider Electric (EcoStruxure, Andover Continuum, TAC) - Johnson Controls (Metasys) - Tridium (Niagara Framework – integrator platform) - Distech Controls - Trend Controls - Delta Controls - Automated Logic (WebCTRL) ### Other Meanings of BMS (context-dependent) - Battery Management System – Used in electric vehicles and battery storage (monitors cell voltage, temperature, state of charge, etc.). - Business Management System – General term for integrated business software. - Bristol-Myers Squibb – Pharmaceutical company (stock ticker BMS). - Burner Management System – Safety system for industrial boilers/furnaces. If you’re asking about a specific type (e.g., building BMS, EV battery BMS) or need details about integration, programming, or a particular brand, let me know and I can go deeper!","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/3903518299939225","likes":10,"shares":5,"comments":2,"views":100,"text_altered":"A BMS most commonly refers to a Building Management System (also called Building Automation System or BAS).

{"post_id":"855967973777292","created_at":"2025-11-06T18:48:11","platform":"facebook","author_id":"100080922927285","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy. The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years. But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost - around $500 a month for higher doses - and insurance coverage has been spotty. Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved. Thursdays announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Drugmakers Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. As with the other deals, its not clear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage. Obesity drugs have become increasingly popular, but are costly The obesity drugs work by targeting hormones in the gut and brain that affect appetite and feelings of fullness. In clinical trials, they helped people shed between 15%% and 22%% of their body weight -- up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. Patients taking these drugs usually start on smaller doses and then work up to larger amounts, depending on their needs. Because of obesity being considered a chronic disease, they need to take the treatment indefinitely or risk regaining weight, experts say. The fast-growing treatments have proven especially lucrative for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk. Lilly said recently that sa #wsbtv #crimewatchatlanta les of Zepbound have tripled so far this year to more than $9 billion. But for many Americans, their cost has made them out of reach. Medicare, the federally funded coverage program mainly for people ages 65 and over, hasnt covered the treatments for obesity. President Donald Trumps predecessor, Joe Biden, proposed a rule last November that would have changed that. But the Trump administration nixed it last spring. Few state and federally funded Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes, offer coverage. And employers and insurers that provide commercial coverage are wary of paying for these drugs in part because of the large number of patients that might use them. The $500 monthly price for higher doses of the treatments also makes them unaffordable for those without insurance, doctors say. Medicare now covers the cost of the drugs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not for weight loss alone. Trump showing he is in touch with cost-of-living concerns The effort to lower costs barriers to popular GLP-1 drugs comes as the White House is looking to demonstrate that Trump is in touch with Americans frustrations with rising costs for food, housing, health care and other necessities. Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia faced a drubbing in Tuesdays election in which dour voter outlook about the economy appeared to an animating factor in the races. Roughly half of Virginia voters said the economy was the top issue, and about 6 in 10 of these voters picked Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, powering her to a decisive win, according to an AP voter poll. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won about two-thirds of voters who called the economy the top issue facing the state, the poll found. She defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. More than half of New York City voters said the cost of living was the top issue facing the city. The Democratic mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won about two-thirds of this group. The White House sought to diminish the effort by the previous Democratic administration as a gift to the pharmaceutical industry because the proposal did not include adequate price concessions from the drug makers. Trump, instead, consummated a belt and suspenders deal that ensures that Americans arent unfairly financing the pharmaceutical industrys innovation, claimed a senior administration official, who briefed reporters ahead of Thursdays Oval Office announcement by Trump. Another senior administration official said coverage of the drugs will expand to Medicare patients starting next year. Those who qualify will pay $50 copays for the medicine. Lower prices also will be phased in for people without coverage through the administrations TrumpRx program, which will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. starting in January. The officials said lower prices also will be provided for state and federally funded Medicaid programs. And starting doses of new, pill versions of the obesity treatments will cost $149 a month if they are approved. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. Doctors applaud the price drop Dr. Leslie Golden says she has roughly 600 patients taking one of these treatments, and 75%% or more struggle to afford them. Even with coverage, some face $150 copayments for refills. Every visit its, How long can we continue to do this. Whats the plan if I cant continue., said Golden, an obesity medicine specialist in Watertown, Wisconsin. Some of them are working additional jobs or delaying retirement so they can continue to pay for it. Both Lilly and Novo have already cut prices on their drugs. Lilly said earlier this year it would reduce the cost of initial doses of Zepbound to $349. The potential to cover the medication for the 30 million people on Medicare who have obesity would be welcome, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. But until details are released, she remains skeptical. I would have to see it to believe it, she said. I need to see something that is more definitive for Medicare beneficiaries. I need to see something that is tangible and sustainable. Dr. Angela Fitch, who also treats patients with obesity, said she hoped a deal between the White House and drugmakers could be the first step in making the treatments more affordable. We need a hero in obesity care today, said Fitch, founder and chief medical officer of knownwell, a weight-loss and medical care company.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years. But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost - around $500 a month for higher doses - and insurance coverage has been spotty. Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved. Thursdays announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Drugmakers Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. As with the other deals, its not clear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage. Obesity drugs have become increasingly popular, but are costly The obesity drugs work by targeting hormones in the gut and brain that affect appetite and feelings of fullness. In clinical trials, they helped people shed between 15%% and 22%% of their body weight -- up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. Patients taking these drugs usually start on smaller doses and then work up to larger amounts, depending on their needs. Because of obesity being considered a chronic disease, they need to take the treatment indefinitely or risk regaining weight, experts say. The fast-growing treatments have proven especially lucrative for drugmakers the pharmaceutical company known for its diabetes treatments and Co. and the global healthcare company specializing in diabetes care. Lilly said recently that sa #wsbtv #crimewatchatlanta les of the obesity treatment that has gained popularity have tripled so far this year to more than $9 billion. But for many Americans, their cost has made them out of reach. Medicare, the federally funded coverage program mainly for people ages 65 and over, hasnt covered the treatments for obesity. President Donald Trumps predecessor, Joe Biden, proposed a rule last November that would have changed that. But the Trump administration nixed it last spring. Few state and federally funded Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes, offer coverage. And employers and insurers that provide commercial coverage are wary of paying for these drugs in part because of the large number of patients that might use them. The $500 monthly price for higher doses of the treatments also makes them unaffordable for those without insurance, doctors say. Medicare now covers the cost of the drugs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not for weight loss alone. Trump showing he is in touch with cost-of-living concerns The effort to lower costs barriers to popular GLP-1 drugs comes as the White House is looking to demonstrate that Trump is in touch with Americans frustrations with rising costs for food, housing, health care and other necessities. Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia faced a drubbing in Tuesdays election in which dour voter outlook about the economy appeared to an animating factor in the races. Roughly half of Virginia voters said the economy was the top issue, and about 6 in 10 of these voters picked Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, powering her to a decisive win, according to an AP voter poll. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won about two-thirds of voters who called the economy the top issue facing the state, the poll found. She defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. More than half of New York City voters said the cost of living was the top issue facing the city. The Democratic mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won about two-thirds of this group. The White House sought to diminish the effort by the previous Democratic administration as a gift to the pharmaceutical industry because the proposal did not include adequate price concessions from the drug makers. Trump, instead, consummated a belt and suspenders deal that ensures that Americans arent unfairly financing the pharmaceutical industrys innovation, claimed a senior administration official, who briefed reporters ahead of Thursdays Oval Office announcement by Trump. Another senior administration official said coverage of the drugs will expand to Medicare patients starting next year. Those who qualify will pay $50 copays for the medicine. Lower prices also will be phased in for people without coverage through the administrations TrumpRx program, which will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. starting in January. The officials said lower prices also will be provided for state and federally funded Medicaid programs. And starting doses of new, pill versions of the obesity treatments will cost $149 a month if they are approved. The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. Doctors applaud the price drop Dr. Leslie Golden says she has roughly 600 patients taking one of these treatments, and 75%% or more struggle to afford them. Even with coverage, some face $150 copayments for refills. Every visit its, How long can we continue to do this. Whats the plan if I cant continue., said Golden, an obesity medicine specialist in Watertown, Wisconsin. Some of them are working additional jobs or delaying retirement so they can continue to pay for it. Both Lilly and Novo have already cut prices on their drugs. Lilly said earlier this year it would reduce the cost of initial doses of the obesity treatment that has gained popularity to $349. The potential to cover the medication for the 30 million people on Medicare who have obesity would be welcome, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. But until details are released, she remains skeptical. I would have to see it to believe it, she said. I need to see something that is more definitive for Medicare beneficiaries. I need to see something that is tangible and sustainable. Dr. Angela Fitch, who also treats patients with obesity, said she hoped a deal between the White House and drugmakers could be the first step in making the treatments more affordable. We need a hero in obesity care today, said Fitch, founder and chief medical officer of knownwell, a weight-loss and medical care company. The community has faced relentless barriers to accessing GLP-1 medications, which has ultimately come down to the price, despite the data we have supporting their effectiveness.

Mom was already anxious about how treatment would go, and that call piled worry right onto her racing mind. She looked confused, scared, unsure why this was happening. ✨️✨️🙏🙏💖💖✨️✨️ Walking into treatment was stressful. Once she got back in the chair, her weight was solid — a big win — but her blood pressure was sky-high. She takes it three times a day, and she hasn’t been on her BP meds since she got sick. It rattled her. It rattled me. But later at home? Her BP was completely normal again.✨️✨️🙏🙏💖💖✨ No updates today about starting Cytoxan since Revlimid has been halted. That adds to her anxiety. So we’re still waiting on that direction. Between the CAR-T call and all the uncertainty, the whole appointment hit heavy. ✨️✨️🙏🙏💖💖✨️✨️ On the ride home, she started tearing up. Everything caught up to her. I held her hand and brought her back to right now — reminded her she’s safe, she’s guided, and she is absolutely not alone. Then something incredible happened. She started reading about CAR-T… about how many high-risk patients have gone into deep remission… and I watched her Spark flicker back to life.✨✨✨ By the time we got home, she felt encouraged, hopeful, and ready to talk about the positive impact this treatment could bring. I told her to get on her stepper to clear her mind — she always feels mentally stronger after she moves her body. And, even after everything today threw at her, this woman crushed a full hour on that stepper. That’s warrior-level determination. ✨️✨️💖💖🙏🙏✨️✨️ I’m so proud of her. She’s fighting physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually — harder than ever. And today, despite the fear and the chaos, my beautiful fighter reignited her Spark. ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️ Sparktastic job today, Mom. I love you. Always, always. XOXO. 💖✨️💖✨️💖✨️💖✨️💖✨️","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/122109371655086182","likes":3,"shares":2,"comments":14,"views":0}

Its growing prevalence affects families, communities, and our entire healthcare system. That is why our mission is clear: Prevention must be our priority. This Agham Kapihan, together with Diabetes Philippines and AstraZeneca Philippines , marks an important milestone as we officially launch the STOP DIABETES: ACT NOW Program. This initiative highlights the need for early action, because diabetes and its complications can be prevented when we intervene early, educate communities, and empower patients to take control of their health. We also recognize the vital support of Philippine Health Insurance Corporation , whose YAKAP Program strengthens early diagnosis by providing essential tests for high-risk individuals. Early detection saves lives, reduces complications, and prevents many Filipinos from progressing to kidney disease and other serious outcomes. Most importantly, today is about partnership. We stand here together with patient groups, the Philippine Diabetes Support community and the Dialysis PH Support Group Inc. We remind that the fight against diabetes and chronic kidney disease is not only a medical battle, but a personal one. 🤝 When government agencies, healthcare providers, patient groups, and private organizations unite, we create a stronger, more hopeful path forward. Together, we can stop diabetes. Together, we can protect Filipino families from CKD. Together, we act now.

I have been, to my mind, happily married for the last 5.5 years to Mickey Regenold. A nurse I worked with at Park Center prior to my wife of 21 years dying of Cancer in 2018. To my great surprise Mickey told me one month ago she was divorcing me. No discussion and no explanation. To this day I do not know why she is divorcing me. But it is clear that our time together has come to an end. I will walk away with gratitude for the 7 years we have shared together and with love in my heart. The following changes are in motion. Divorce will be final on Jan 15, 2026. I am buying a house in Kendallville, IN which is only about 8 miles from where I work. It should close on 12/15/25 and I anticipate moving in over Christmas s. I work at a CMHC as a psychiatrist and I work M - Thursday. I am also a national speaker for Bristol Myers Squibb on their new Schizophrenic drug, Cobenfy. On the personal side I have concluded that the main reason the marriage failed was because of a lack of good communication. Wherever something came up that involved any emotions, Mickey would shut down and refuse to talk about it. Over 5 years this amounted to more and more broken communications that could never have a complete cycle to finish them. I believe this broke the marriage. There are more issues that involve personal history which I am not at liberty to discuss. I will be looking to explore future relationships. Important issues for me are: #1 good communication, #2 I enjoy touch and have felt a severe absence of this in my marriage, $3 I would enjoy being able to discuss politics - for this reason I will not date anyone who voted for Trump. I understand that living in Indiana this limits me to a much smaller percentage of the populaton - but I accept that. Such is my update for now.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/3035169216683890","likes":5,"shares":0,"comments":18,"views":0,"text_altered":"Greetings everyone, Having never been a Facebook user I decided based on current life changes that it is time to start.

As some of you may have known, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Cecal Mucinous Adenocarcinoma (Colorectal Cancer) last November 2022. I have tried herbal medicines for a while, but unfortunately, none of them have worked for me. My oncologist then advised me to undergo immunotherapy as he believes this is a better approach considering the type of cancer I have. It took my family some convincing, but finally, they agreed to let me pursue this treatment. I have high hopes that this would work for me, but I have to admit, I'm super worried as this therapy is expensive. We’re happy to be able to get a discount for Keytruda Patient Access Program (KEYPAP), the medicine for the treatment. However, even with this discount, the costs are still significant due to the number of sessions I need to complete (4-6 sessions every three weeks) and the frequency of PET CT scans required for reevaluation. We’re also applying for government assistance but we’re unsure if help would arrive on time. In light of this, I find myself humbly reaching out for your support. Any financial help you can offer would greatly help as I begin with the treatment. And if you could keep me in your thoughts and prayers, that would mean so much. I know so many of us are facing tough times and I sincerely wish our circumstances are better.. So truly, thank you so much for your kindness and taking the time to read this.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was in the middle of her speech, waving her printed Green New Deal 2.0 like a victory flag, accusing Senator John Kennedy of being a “dinosaur” for opposing her $93 trillion climate plan. Then, Kennedy rose, holding a plain manila folder labeled “DEM RECEIPTS – DO NOT BEND.” He didn’t wait for the chair to recognize him—he just started reading: \"AOC: Net worth jump (2020-2025): $29,000 → $12.4 million Campaign promise: 'No corporate PAC money' – Actual donors: BlackRock, Google, Pfizer – $4.7 million in dark money funneled through ActBlue shells Bartender story: last W-2 showed $26k – while mommy’s seven rental properties paid the real bills Green New Deal co-author: Saikat Chakrabarti – fired for funneling $1.2 million to his own LLC\" Then, turning to Chuck Schumer’s turn in the crosshairs: \"Chuck Schumer: Current residence: $8.2 million Park Slope brownstone Wife’s net worth: $47 million from Goldman Sachs board seat Inflation Reduction Act: gave $370 billion to green companies – 42 of which donated to his PAC the same week\" The final kill-shot: “$93 trillion over 10 years = $714,000 per U.S. household Average NYC household income: $71k That’s 10 years of every dollar they earn – gone before breakfast.” Kennedy closed the folder and stared directly at AOC. “Darlin’, I did the homework. You want $93 trillion from people who can’t afford groceries while you fly private to COP climate conferences? Take your trust-fund socialism and stick it where the Green New Deal don’t shine.” The chamber went silent—no gasps, just pure stillness. AOC stood speechless, Schumer’s glasses slid down his nose, and C-SPAN's live feed exploded to 28 million viewers, the highest in history. Kennedy’s \"folder of truth\" remained on the podium like a tombstone. The hashtag 1 worldwide for 36 straight hours. AOC deleted her Twitter for 14 hours, while Schumer’s office called it “McCarthyism.” Kennedy shot back with a tweet of his own, posted alongside a photo of a Louisiana food-stamp line: “McCarthyism is promising utopia while picking pockets.” The folder is now locked in the Senate archives, but America read every page.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/2107218223447447","likes":5375,"shares":1175,"comments":1061,"views":0}

This reduces the precision and applicability of findings for booster doses of these vaccines.\nPotential Misclassification of Outcomes\nMyocarditis was identified solely through ICD-10 codes from hospital admissions or death certifications. This reliance on administrative coding could lead to over- or underestimation of true incidence due to diagnostic errors, inconsistent coding practices, or missed mild cases not requiring hospitalization. The authors note: \"Reliance on hospital admission codes and death certification for defining myocarditis may lead to over- or underestimation due to misclassification.\"\nSmall Subgroup Sizes: In the 13-17 years age group, only 56 myocarditis events occurred overall, with just 16 post-vaccination. This low event count precluded separate risk evaluations for this subgroup, limiting insights into adolescent-specific risks.\nExclusion of Recurrent Events: The analysis focused only on the first myocarditis occurrence, so results for third (booster) doses do not account for repeated events in the same individuals, potentially underestimating cumulative risk.\nInability to Compare Mortality Outcomes**: The study restricted analyses to vaccinated individuals, making it impossible to directly compare myocarditis-related death rates between infected (unvaccinated) and vaccinated groups. This may underestimate mortality risks specifically after SARS-CoV-2 infection alone.\nPrecision Issues with mRNA-1273\nFewer people received mRNA-1273 compared to other vaccines, and recipients were on average younger (mean age ~32 years vs. mid-40s/50s for others). This smaller sample size reduced statistical precision for this vaccine, and the age difference could confound observed higher risks, as younger age is a known risk factor for vaccine-associated myocarditis.\nInferred Flaws and Weaknesses Based on Study Design\nWhile the authors conducted robustness checks (e.g., sensitivity analyses for reporting delays and exclusions), the design introduces other potential issues:\nIncomplete Capture of SARS-CoV-2 Infections**: Only 13.9% of the vaccinated population had a positive test recorded, likely due to under-testing. This could bias comparisons between infection- and vaccination-related risks, as many infections may have gone undetected, leading to underestimation of infection-attributable myocarditis.\nUnmeasured Confounders\nAdjustments were made for age, sex, and calendar time, but factors like comorbidities, genetic predispositions, prior infections, or behavioral differences (e.g., healthcare-seeking patterns) were not accounted for. In a self-controlled design, this is partially mitigated by within-person comparisons, but residual confounding remains possible, especially for time-varying exposures.\nTemporal and Generalizability Constraints Data covered December 2020 to December 2021, capturing early pandemic waves and initial vaccine rollouts with specific variants (e.g., Alpha/Delta). Results may not generalize to later periods with Omicron variants, updated vaccines, or different populations outside England (e.g., varying demographics, healthcare systems, or vaccination policies). The study also excludes unvaccinated individuals for direct infection-risk comparisons.\nShort Observation Windows and Event Rarity Risk intervals were limited to 1-28 days post-exposure, potentially missing longer-term effects. With only 2,861 total myocarditis cases (0.007% of the population), rare events in subgroups amplify uncertainty in incidence rate ratios (IRRs), even if overall estimates are robust.\nSelf-Controlled Case Series Biases This design assumes events are independent across periods and that individuals serve as their own controls","language":"en","url":"https://x.com/i/web/status/1989926166472380421","likes":0,"shares":0,"comments":0,"views":80}

When this protein, FSP1, was blocked, lung tumors in mice shrank dramatically, with many cancer cells essentially triggering their own self-destruct mode. The work points to a fresh strategy for targeting stubborn lung cancers. Share: FULL STORY Protein Block Makes Cancer Self-Destruct Stopping one protein forces lung cancer cells to self-destruct. Credit: Shutterstock Researchers at NYU Langone Health have identified how a specific form of cell death linked to the buildup of highly reactive molecules can slow the growth of lung tumors. This type of cell death, known as ferroptosis, originally evolved as a way for the body to clear out cells that become overly stressed. Cancer cells fall into this category, yet over time they have developed ways to block ferroptosis so they can continue multiplying even under damaging conditions. Blocking FSP1 Dramatically Weakens Lung Tumors A study published online November 5 in Nature showed that an experimental therapy targeting a protein called ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) significantly reduced tumor growth in mice with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Blocking this protein, which helps cancer cells avoid ferroptosis, shrank tumors by as much as 80%. Lung cancer remains the world's leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and LUAD is the most common form among nonsmokers, accounting for about 40% of cases. \"This first test of a drug that blocks ferroptosis suppression highlights the importance of the process to cancer cell survivaland paves the way for a new treatment strategy,\" said senior study author Thales Papagiannakopoulos, PhD[GW1], an associate professor in the Department of Pathology[GW2] at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Reactive Molecules and Their Role in Cell Damage Ferroptosis takes place when iron levels rise inside cells, fueling the production of highly reactive molecules made from oxygen, water, and hydrogen peroxide known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). In small amounts, ROS help cells communicate. In excess, they create oxidative stress, which occurs when ROS add oxygen molecules to vital proteins and DNA, damaging or breaking them apart. ROS can also harm fats that form the outer membranes of cells, contributing to cell death and tissue injury. Blocking FSP1 Shows Strong Tumor-Suppressing Effects To investigate how FSP1 affects lung cancer, the research team genetically modified mice so that their lung cancer cells lacked the FSP1 gene. These mice developed smaller tumors due to increased cancer cell death. The researchers also tested icFSP1, a newer drug designed to inhibit FSP1. Mice treated with icFSP1 lived longer and experienced tumor reductions similar to those seen in mice whose cancer cells were engineered to lack FSP1. The study also found that FSP1 may be a more promising treatment target than another ferroptosis-blocking protein, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which has been studied in cancer research for a longer period. The findings suggest that FSP1 is more actively involved in preventing ferroptosis in lung cancer cells while playing a smaller role in normal cell function (which could translate to fewer side effects). Increased levels of FSP1 were also associated with poorer survival rates in human LUAD patients, unlike GPX4. Future Directions and Ongoing Research \"Our future research will focus on optimizing FSP1 inhibitors and investigating the potential of harnessing ferroptosis as a treatment strategy for other solid tumors, such as pancreatic cancer,\" said lead study author Katherine Wu, an MD/PhD student working in the Papagiannakopoulos lab. \"We aim to translate these findings from the lab into novel clinical therapies for cancer patients.\" In addition to Wu and Pagagiannakopoulos, contributors from the Department of Pathology at NYU Langone include co-first author Alec Vaughan, Jozef Bossowski, Yuan Hao, Aikaterini Ziogou, Mari Nakamura, Ray Pillai, Mariana Mancini, Sahith Rajalingam, and Suckwoo Chung.

My step father was treated for metastatic cancer, responded phenomenally well, then was put on immunotherapy. After the first dose he had seizures and some mild confusion. The oncologist ignored it and never pursued further. He got a second dose and essentially disappeared overnight. He is now in the hospital with suspected autoimmune encephalitis. He has all the symptoms. He can’t have an LP until he’s been off of eliquis for 3 days, which further delays treatment. We are concerned about steroids since it could cause his cancer to recur. But obviously we understand that’s the first line treatment. Has anyone had success with high dose vitamin c to help reduce inflammation and protect the brain? It feels helpless to just sit and wait for 3 days and do nothing when there’s already been a delay. Has anyone used alternative treatments or protocols and seen success? Just looking for any guidance here…thank you in advance. This is all new and we are devastated and scared and just want him back.","language":"en","url":"https://www.facebook.com/1437167607894764","likes":3,"shares":0,"comments":18,"views":0}

The primary allegations center around claims that the talc used in their products was contaminated with Asbestos, a known carcinogen, leading to deadly cancers, particularly Ovarian cancer and Mesothelioma (a rare form of cancer often linked to asbestos exposure). The lawsuits have garnered widespread attention, with plaintiffs alleging that prolonged use of Johnson & Johnson’s talc-based powders, especially in the genital area, contributed to their cancer diagnoses. The plaintiffs claim that the company failed to adequately warn consumers about the risks associated with talc, despite mounting evidence linking talc to cancer. Allegations of Asbestos Contamination Central to the legal claims is the allegation that talc a mineral often used in cosmetic and personal care products was contaminated with traces of Asbestos. Asbestos is a naturally occurring substance that has been proven to cause various forms of cancer, including Lung cancer, Mesothelioma and Ovarian cancer. Plaintiffs argue that Johnson & Johnson's failure to remove asbestos from their talc-based powders or provide adequate warnings contributed to their illnesses. Over the years, the company has faced growing scrutiny regarding the safety of its talc products. In 2018, an Investigation revealed that traces of asbestos were found in some batches of Johnson & Johnson’s talc. Although Johnson & Johnson has continuously maintained that its products are safe, the ongoing legal actions continue to fuel public concern about the potential health risks of talc-based powders. Johnson & Johnson’s Response In response to the numerous lawsuits, Johnson & Johnson has firmly rejected the claims, maintaining that its talc-based baby powder is safe and does not cause cancer. The company argues that multiple scientific studies and tests have concluded that their products do not contain asbestos and are free from any cancer causing substances. However, the company’s position has not stopped the growing tide of litigation. In 2020, in response to both legal and consumer pressures, Johnson & Johnson announced that it would stop selling its talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada, opting instead to focus on cornstarch based alternatives. The move was seen as a way to address consumer concerns, though the company maintained that the decision was not an admission of guilt regarding cancer risk. The Los Angeles Lawsuit Verdict The legal troubles for Johnson & Johnson recently escalated when a Los Angeles jury ordered the company to pay a staggering $966 million in damages to a woman who claimed that her use of the talc-based baby powder caused her to develop ovarian cancer. This ruling added significant weight to the ongoing legal challenges and sparked further public debate over the safety of talc in personal care products. The case in Los Angeles was just one of many ongoing lawsuits, with plaintiffs in the UK and other parts of the world continuing to seek justice for the alleged health risks associated with Johnson & Johnson’s talc products. Health Awareness and Consumer Safety The controversy surrounding talc-based products has raised important health awareness concerns, especially for consumers who have used these products over an extended period of time. Health professionals have long warned about the potential risks of asbestos exposure, and the growing body of legal evidence linking talc to cancer has prompted calls for more stringent regulation and clearer consumer warnings. Consumers are encouraged to carefully review the ingredients in personal care products and to be aware of any Possible health risks associated with their use. People who have used talc-based baby powder or similar products for years and are experiencing symptoms of ovarian cancer or other related health conditions should consult with a healthcare provider for guidance and potential testing. As the legal battle continues, the focus remains on the safety and regulation of personal care products, as well as the responsibility of corporations to ensure that their products do not pose harm to consumers. Looking Ahead The future of Johnson & Johnson’s talc products remains uncertain as more lawsuits are expected to surface in the coming months. The company faces mounting pressure from plaintiffs and health advocates who argue that the public deserves greater transparency and accountability from manufacturers. With the legal outcome still pending, many are left questioning the safety of talc-based products and the impact they have on public health.

The donation was made through the Multinational Lung Cancer Control Program (MLCCP), implemented by Access to Health Zambia and Zambart, with support from the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation. Speaking during the ceremony, Copperbelt Provincial Health Director, Dr. Charles Mwinuna, represented by Dr. Nasilele Simushi, described the donation as a major step toward improving early detection and management of lung cancer, tuberculosis, and other respiratory conditions on the Copperbelt. He said the bronchoscopy machine represents more than a technological upgrade, stressing that it symbolizes progress, innovation, and the power of collaboration in improving public health outcomes. “Bronchoscopy is a critical diagnostic tool that enables clinicians to detect lung abnormalities early. By enhancing diagnostic capacity here in the Copperbelt, we move a step closer to reducing the burden of respiratory diseases and improving patient outcomes,” he said. Dr. Mwinuna applauded Access to Health Zambia and Zambart for their leadership in research and health system strengthening, stating that their partnership with Ndola Teaching Hospital demonstrates how collaboration can deliver meaningful healthcare solutions. He urged the hospital’s management and clinical staff to ensure optimal use and proper maintenance of the machine to improve service delivery. “As we receive this bronchoscopy machine, let us renew our commitment to advancing health equity, investing in technology, and building a resilient healthcare system for the people of Zambia,” he added. Access to Health Zambia Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Batuke Walusiku-Mwewa, said the donation aligns with national efforts to combat cancer and expand specialized healthcare services. She highlighted that the partnership with Zambart and the Ministry of Health under the MLCCP has strengthened cancer awareness, trained community health workers, and expanded lung cancer screening in Ndola and Kabwe. “As part of this ongoing work, we are proud to hand over a bronchoscopy machine, laptops, tablets, and a desktop computer to enhance diagnostics, data management, and research,” she said. Zambart Executive Director, Dr. Kwame Shanaube, commended the partnership, noting that improved diagnostic equipment is essential for reducing delays in lung cancer detection and improving treatment outcomes. She emphasized that bronchoscopy capacity at Ndola Teaching Hospital will help reduce misdiagnosis and delays in patient care. Meanwhile, Ndola Teaching Hospital Acting Head Clinical Care, Dr. Tela Bulaya, thanked Zambart, Access to Health Zambia, and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation for the donation, describing it as a milestone in advancing the hospital’s respiratory services. “For years, patients suspected of having lung cancer or other respiratory complications had to be referred to Lusaka at great financial and emotional cost,” she said. “Today, that burden has been lifted. This machine brings life-saving diagnostic services closer to the people.” Dr. Bulaya assured partners that the equipment will be properly maintained and fully utilized, supported through continuous staff training. She also acknowledged the efforts of the Internal Medicine, Respiratory, and Biomedical Engineering teams whose dedication made the milestone possible. The newly commissioned bronchoscopy machine is expected to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce referral delays, and strengthen Ndola Teaching Hospital’s role as a regional centre for specialized healthcare services.
